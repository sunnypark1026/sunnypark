ddlovato,,"#TransTakeover #TransAwarenessWeek #tdor Boxing is more than a sport. I donâ€™t know who I would be if I hadnâ€™t wandered into a gym as a miserable teenager. I have been able to see the world, have a positive impact on my community, gained friends and family...but there are many who donâ€™t want trans athletes to be a part of the athletic world. Despite all the misinformation, trans athletes want the same as every athlete: a chance to participate and grow with the sport they love. We canâ€™t fight this battle alone and fortunately we donâ€™t have to. @AthleteAlly works to dismantle the structures of oppression that isolate, exclude and endanger LGBTQI+ people in sport, especially trans and nonbinary youth. In the past year, 19 states in the US have introduced horrific legislation targeting trans youth and their ability to play sports simply because of who they are.Â Â  Because of COVID-19, LGBTQI+ youth are at increased risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Sports are proven to reduce depression for LGBTQI+ youth. All athletes, and especially trans youth, deserve life-saving access to sports. Join Athlete Ally and help us fight to make sports welcoming for all. #TDOR #PROTECTTRANSYOUTH"
ddlovato,,"#TransTakeover #TransAwarenessWeek #tdor [Content Warning: child sexual abuse] Iâ€™m not a survivor of child sexual abuse, but so many of my loved ones are. Since 20% of Americans are survivors, you or someone you know has lived through this violence. And if youâ€™re a transgender or gender non-conforming child, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, youâ€™re more at risk of being targeted. My partner founded @mirror.memoirs so that transgender, non-binary, intersex and queer survivors of color have a place to share their stories, find healing community, and organize together to end rape culture. And they welcome the involvement of ANYONE who wants to live in a world without child sexual abuse. If you are in crisis and need immediate help, you can contact @trevorproject 24/7 toll-free hotline via phone (866-488-7386) or text START to 678-678 to access a confidential counselor.

Iâ€™m taking over Demiâ€™s IG page today as part of the ","#TransTakeover campaign for #TransAwarenessWeek and #tdor.Iâ€™m a fighter in every sense of the word. I am not only a professional boxer, but I am committed to fighting for a world where being yourself isnâ€™t an act of bravery.Iâ€™ve had to make history in order to be my true self - from a highly decorated female amateur boxing champion to the first professional male boxer who is transgender to compete and win, to the first transgender athlete to become the face of Everlast, Iâ€™ve never allowed others to define me. Today is Trans Day of Remembrance, a day we dedicate not only to mourning those in the transgender community who lost their lives to anti-trans violence this year, but also to celebrating the resilience of all of us who are still here. Iâ€™ve been invited to share more about myself, my journey to being the first and the causes that are dear to my heart.

gabunion,In honor of ,"#VeteransDay, todayâ€™s #WCW is Marcelite J. Harris, the first black female major general in the US military. While in the Air Force Academy, sheÂ became the first female aircraft maintenance officer and one of the first two female commanding officers. Harris also worked as a White House social aide and personal staff officer under Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. In 1997, she retired from the Air Force as the highest-ranking female officer in the Air Force and the nationâ€™s highest-ranking black woman in the Department of Defense.Â She was recently buried in Arlington National Cemetery to rest in power. We honor her memory today and everyday. Happy Veterans Day. Let us lift her up in the light of goodness and hold her there ."

Amo-vos sobre todas as coisas, e minha alma suspira por VÃ³s. Mas, como nÃ£o posso receber-Vos agora no SantÃ­ssimo Sacramento, vinde, ao menos espiritualmente, a meu coraÃ§Ã£o.

isabellafiorentino,"Hoje, dia 17 de novembro, eÌ o dia Internacional da prematuridade! Meus trigeÌ‚meos vieram ao mundo com apenas 27 semanas. Foram 90 dias de UTI, e uma montanha russa de emocÌ§oÌƒes! Hoje, me solidarizo com todas as maÌƒes que estaÌƒo passando por esse momento, e digo uma coisa: Deus estaÌ nos carregando no colo, nos amparando,dando forcÌ§as,  pra conseguirmos passar por todas as IntercorreÌ‚ncias que a prematuridade pode causar, com feÌ, esperancÌ§a e sempre acreditando que tudo vai dar certo! Comigo foi assim! No dia em  que sai do hospital e tive que deixar os treÌ‚s na UTI dentro das incubadoras, foi um dos dias mais vazios da minha vida! Eu naÌƒo tinha mais a companhia deles na minha barriga (fiquei em repouso absoluto por 4 meses, nem nos bercinhos  que eu tinha preparado para eles! Mas o dia que cheguei em casa com eles nos bracÌ§os... foi  o dia mais cheio de alegria da minha vida! Hoje quando olho pra cada um dos meus filhos, a imagem que vem a minha cabecÌ§a saÌƒo essas, de quando eles eram extremamente pequenos e fraÌgeis... e digo: Que privilegiada sou eu,  que posso  ver o Milagre acontecer bem diante dos meus olhos! Vibro tanto a cada conquista deles! Obrigada Meu Deus, minha Nossa Senhora que me ampararam  e me amparam ateÌ hj! Bernardo, Lorenzo e Nicholas, e meu marido Stefano: vcs saÌƒo a minha vida!!! A primeira foto foi qdo consegui carregar os treÌ‚s juntos pela primeira vez. A segunda foto, era a forma q eu segurava cada um deles: enfiava dentro do meu top de ginaÌstica Pra fazer mae canguruÌ. A terceira, foi num momento que estava com dois deles. A quarta foto foi na maternidade qdo eles finalmente estavam livres dos fios!! E a uÌltima foto, foi qdo levei o uÌltimo bebeÌ‚ pra casa e finalmente estaÌvamos livres do hospital! ( sim, saiÌram um de cada vez, me dividia entre as mamadas dos q estavam em casa com os q estavam ainda no hospital! Rotina insana! ",#trigemeos #triplets #prematuridade #prematuroextremo

oliviaculpo,"Yesterday I had surgery for my endometriosis â¤ï¸ Not a very glamorous post but I felt like I needed to share this to create more awareness around this disease. Endometriosis is a condition where tissue from the uterine lining decides to grow in other random parts of your body, causing pain. This can interfere with fertility and overall health and honestly - happiness.Â Â To top things off it is excruciatingly painful but nearly impossible to see through an ultrasound (unless you have endometrioma/chocolate cysts on your ovaries- thatâ€™s what I had). I have been in agony for years around my period and I was misdiagnosed countless times by doctors. â€œJust take Tylenol every dayâ€ â€œultrasound looks normal,â€ â€œ I think you just need to rest more, periods are always uncomfortable for people,â€ etc. I know a lot of people out there in the Endo community are familiar with these diagnoses which is why I am so passionate about this. Painful periods are not normal!!! I want to say thank you to @drvilasagar_endosurgeon and the amazing hospital staff at @atriumhealth who took care of me. You guys were literally angels to me and I am so grateful. To anyone out there who has endometriosis, I understand the depression, and overall loneliness that can occur with a conditionÂ Â that is so painful yet so hard to be interpreted by other people outside of the body. Itâ€™s hard when chronic pain is not validated and you donâ€™t get an answer or understanding. To my Endo warriors, I will continue to spread more awareness around endometriosis so that your symptoms can be validated. You are not alone and you are so strong !!!!",

Take care of your â€œmind-body!â€ Work out, read a book, or take a moment to pamper yourself. Also, we have to be mindful of everyday stresses to our skin (UV rays, pollution, etc.). Thatâ€™s why my newest skincare addition is the gold-stabilized Vita-C Glycolic Brightening Serum and Vita-C Eye Dark Circle Corrector from @muradskincare. The serum has made my skin healthier and brighter while the Dark Circle Corrector has helped reduce my dark circles due to lack of sleep. The gold-stabilized vitamin C is stable, easily penetrates skin, doesnâ€™t lose effectiveness over time, and is bioavailable. Find it on murad.com, @sephora, or @ultabeauty ",#muradpartner

She is so beautiful even first thing in the morning with no makeup on. My personal favorite look ğŸ˜3. Sheâ€™s glowing! The candles only reflect light on those that have an open heart and care about doing good for others. And sheâ€™s always thinking of how she can support her family and friends. 4. Sheâ€™s setting an intention - she has come from nothing in a small town in Mexico and the last 10 years transformed her mind, body and skills to get to where she is now. Sheâ€™s always dreaming big and visualizing what she wants... but then backs it up with massive action. Watch out next year! 5. @iamthemamacita is sneaking a taste while Yanet has her eyes closed. Always taking advantage of any chance she can get some sugar ğŸ˜ Happy birthday amor, I hope this year you create and receive everything you want ğŸ‰"

jessicabiel,Halloween movies are scary and all - but 2020 IRL is about to get a lot scarier if we donâ€™t get out there and VOTE. Only a few more days!!! Text 3 friends over the next 3 days and make sure theyâ€™re all set to get their ballot in. ,#FBF
jessicabiel,,"#VOTE with love, empathy, and for those whose voices arenâ€™t as loud as your own â¤ï¸"
jessicabiel,Today is International ,"#DayoftheGirl â€” and Iâ€™m proud to share my story in support of #TheGirlEffect. â €â €Society told me I was SUPPOSED TO be nice, be pretty, be sweet, be feminine. Instead, I CHOSE TO own my strength, cultivate my mind, and embrace my power.Â Â â €â €At a young age, so many girls are taught to be comfortable walking two steps behind their male peers. As someone who always identified in mind and body as an athlete â€“â€“Â that never made sense to me. Women are powerful and thatâ€™s a great thing. Even though it scares the sh*t out of people.Â Â â €â €While the gender stereotypes have evolved and weâ€™ve come a long way â€” itâ€™s still so important for little girls everywhere to recognize that they are capable of everything - and more. We have to teach all children equality so that one day, girls will be represented EVERYWHERE that decisions are made. â €â €Tag just one friend who inspires you to share your SUPPOSED TO / CHOSE TO story. Why just one? Because when one girl finds her power to make different choices that change her life, it inspires others to do the sameâ€¦and THAT changes the world. Learn more at @girleffect. â €â €â¤ï¸"

keke,"There are so many cool jobs on a set outside of being the actor on film.Thereâ€™s the Director of Photography that makes sure our shots and lighting look perfect. (our DP on ALICE also worked on WATCHMEN, heâ€™s truly incredible to watch and learn from.)Thereâ€™s the continuity person that literally watches for mistakes like someoneâ€™s hair was in front when it was supposed to be behind. Thereâ€™s the sound engineer who makes sure the mixes sound good on set as well as the boom operator thatâ€™s up close holding a lower mic for extra support during scenes. (The mics are heavy btw and some scenes are really long!)You have the PAâ€™s who make sure everyone is where they need to be, they are assistants to production. You also have camera asstâ€™s that mark where you are supposed to walk to ensure shot accuracy. And assist the camera operator and all their needs. As well as the actual camera operator.(They are amongst the highest paid on set. Sometimes they are locked in before the actors.) The job requires a lot of physical stability and patience depending on their speciality. Then you have the FIRST AD. Very integral part of a shoot. They have one of the hardest jobs working with locations in order to make sure we can shoot this day or that day and what times. Whew! Not to mention handling all the personalities on set. We have an amazing FIRST AD on â€œALICEâ€ â¤ï¸And the GRIPS! We can never forget the grips. On the first day of â€œALICEâ€ I got reconnected with the same Key Grip that I worked with on â€œAkeelah and The Beeâ€ and â€œThe Longshotsâ€. They are the ones that essentially set up everything! They are a huge back bone on a onset production. Thereâ€™s also KRAFTY! KRAFTY makes food and keeps snacks around all day on set and ensure that we eat while we work as sometimes we donâ€™t get to stop to eat. (Outside of one lunch)Anyhow! There are so many more from costumes, to electrics, to hair and makeup, to transpo, to locations, to PROPS(not to be confused with Art Department because props handles everything an actor TOUCHES). I say that to say, the actors are not the coolest on most sets. Itâ€™s always THE CREW!",

I had to touch some of the saddest parts of my soul and I thank you for being gentle the entire way through. Krystin comes from a unique background and strong women! Her grandmother and cousin were members of the Black Panther Party in Oakland. She also wrote â€œALICEâ€ and is one of the strongest women Iâ€™ve ever met!

niasioux,Todayâ€™s ,"#RoleModelMonday is Monique Grayson. Monique is a pilot who started flying when she was 19! After her first flight at the age of 12, she developed a curiosity for flying and wanted to know how everything worked. This led her to going to school and pursuing her dreams of becoming a pilot. Monique said many people in the airport / on flights assume she is a flight attendant, and based on the statistics, itâ€™s no wonder why. Only 3% of pilots are black, and only 7% of pilots are women. She is truly a trailblazer and sets an example for future pilots who may not have otherwise SEEN themselves in this role. Thank you for opening our eyes to what is possible!"

emilysears,"When we feel good, we make good choices. @1stphorm microfactor vitamin packs are comprehensive  multivitamin sachets. The ","#1 agenda when it comes to fitness goals should be health before how our bodies look. Weight loss/gains come as a by product to a healthy lifestyle and choices. When our first priority is fundamentally operating in a healthy state we feel the energy, confidence, mental clarity, focus and happiness that make positive choices come naturally. Beginning with health is the foundation to build body goals from, it can be the other way around for the short term but itâ€™s not sustainable. Get healthy-then build your butt, work up to having abs-whatever your goal is! Sure you can lose weight crash dieting but youâ€™re going to feel like shit, have no energy, feel depressed and burn out. Then the shame builds and you regress to a worse state than you were before.

Iâ€™ll be taking over Stellaâ€™s Instagram today for ,"#Sharethemicuk a project magnifying  black womenâ€™s voices for #BlackHistoryMonth-Iâ€™m a British Born Nigerian Fashion Designer, Cultural Consultant and Host of creative womenâ€™s podcast - TTYA Talks. I launched @ttyalondon in 2013, frustrated with the fashion industry. â€˜Diversity & Inclusionâ€™ had become marketing buzz words - Why werenâ€™t tall girls included in the conversation? Why couldnâ€™t I see brands reflecting the people I saw around me? With TTYA I decided to create a space, one which included outsiders like myself.I stand for representation and inclusion utilising my network to empower the next generation to see more black creatives! The TTYA community spans the globe; in my work as a cultural consultant at the intersection of music, nightlife and fashion I have had the chance to connect with so many like minds; we share ideas, visions, ambitions.So if your an outsider like me or donâ€™t really feel like thereâ€™s a narrative that speaks to you I hope you get inspired today! Stay tuned to insta stories for more @sharethemicuk ğŸ’–"

Muitas mulheres estÃ£o tÃ£o focadas em pernas e abdÃ´men que na maioria das vezes tendem a esquecer que temos outros grupos musculares muito importantes! Nossas costas por exemplo Ã© uma ferramenta poderosa na prevenÃ§Ã£o de vÃ¡rios tipos de lesÃµes, dÃ£o ""apoio"" para o nosso dia a dia , melhoram a postura e fazem a nossa cintura parecer menor ğŸ˜³ğŸ‘ğŸ˜‰ quem nao quer uma cintura menor? Por favor , nao ignore mais esse grupo muscular, costas fortalecidas Ã© bonito e saudÃ¡vel !!Os DeltÃ³ides fortalecidos podem compensar uma cintura larga ou membros inferiores exagerados. Ombros mais largos vÃ£o dar tambÃ©m aparÃªncia de uma cintura menor e equilibrar a relaÃ§Ã£o com os membros inferiores, dando ao seu corpo um aspecto mais harmÃ´nico. Se vocÃª quer dar esse efeito visual de cintura mais fina, a dica Ã© trabalhar ombros, dorsal e redondos, explore exercÃ­cios como as puxadas e pullovers, alÃ©m de todas as elevaÃ§Ãµes e desenvolvimentos, Ã³timos exercÃ­cios para mulheres! Meninas nÃ£o deixem de treinar membros superiores, vocÃª vai ficar mais durinha, torneada, definida e harmÃ´nica! Em situaÃ§Ãµes naturais vocÃª jamais ficarÃ¡ masculina!",

All the ","#PhotoVogueFestival talks are free and youâ€™re all welcome! A sign language interpreter will join the conversation to make it accessible also to those with sensory disabilities.  Embracing gender fluidity, the diversity of bodies and beauty types, regardless of race and ethnic group, is a conquest that is changing the aesthetic standards of our times, thereby proceeding to change peopleâ€™s cultural and identity codes in terms of inclusivity, openness and dialogue. And yet, much still needs to be done, for instance, with regard to the representation of disability. An issue dear to Photo Vogue Festival and its Artistic Director Alessia Glaviano from its first edition. Glaviano will talk about the changes that we are witnessing in regard to the representation of people with disabilities in the fashion industry with Aaron Philip, the first model with disability to be the face of a major high fashion brand, and Claudia Walder, editor, creative director and disability activist."

Thank you for allowing me to be vulnerable and spill out my lil human ass heart. Iâ€™m soooo thankful for your love as well as everything I have learned this year.

sarahstage,"Marriage is not always beautiful.Marriage gets ugly. You see the absolute worst in each other. You see them mad, you see them be stubborn, you see them be unlovable. But you also get to see them laughing with you  so hard that you both cry ğŸ˜­ğŸ¤£ You see them at 3am, when the rest of the world is asleep, it's just the two of you snacking away, laughing, connecting in a way no one else ever could. You get to see a side of them no one else does. Snorting while laughing, bad morning breath, bedhead, the random dances in the kitchen, the bad days, but all the joy.Marriage isn't always beautiful, but it is amazing. It's knowing that someone loves you so much that they won't leave you when things get tough. It's working through the frustrations of dishes piling up, clothes on the floor, blaming one another but getting it done one way or another. It's rubbing their back when they're sore or had a long day. It's the dirtiest, hardest, most rewarding relationship there is next to being a parent. Because at the end of the day, you get to love and be loved by your best friend, the weirdest, most annoying, goofy, perfect person you know.Marriage isn't always beautiful, but it's one hell of a heavenly ride.Blessed to have my ride or die working out with meğŸ’ªğŸ¼ we stopped by @7eleven and got @ashocenergy since we had a late night ğŸ¤­",

valegenta,"This year was definitely a whirlwind of emotions, for everybody. There was good days and bad days and everything in between. We went through some of the strangest situations but we did it as a team. And thatâ€™s something I learned this year that is one of the more important lessons Iâ€™ve ever learned. They donâ€™t teach this at school but they should...We donâ€™t all have to be individuals, we could all be a team. The struggles we all faced this year were oddly comforting in a sense because we were going through them together. So with that being said, if thereâ€™s one thing you take away from 2020 (other than washing your hands), let it be that we need one another. That the support system you have is something to be grateful about. To be there for others when times get tough. No matter opinions or perspectives, we are all human. Letâ€™s support each other and be FRIENDS!!! The world is a cruel place, why donâ€™t you make it a little bit better by simply being kind & offering a hand every so often?

jimchapman,"Ad Howâ€™s lockdown going?This second one has been tough for me - just when I started to get back into the swing of things, the country ground to a halt again and it set me off a little. Iâ€™ve spent the last few days going easy on myself and Iâ€™m feeling much more positive about using this time wisely and constructively. Iâ€™ve also been checking in with my friends because itâ€™s never been more important to look out for out mental health. Itâ€™s also a good time to remember the incredible lengths our keyworkers go to to keep this country running. As the number of cases spike, theyâ€™re going above and beyond, but it can take a toll on them. Hopefully youâ€™ve seen by now (Iâ€™ve been going on about it!), Iâ€™m an ambassador for @GilletteUKâ€™s partnership with @Movember and I really believe this yearâ€™s campaign can make a difference. We're fundraising to support the mental health of our keyworkers. Itâ€™s time we recognise, celebrate and support these people. Every Mo that is grown throughout the November will contribute. It could quite literally save lives, be it through funds raised, awareness increased, or just as a conversation starter: whatever you grow can save a bro. Itâ€™s not too late to shave down and grow your own Mo â€“ Itâ€™s such a simple ask and it could have a massive impact. To help you craft those beautiful (or ridculous) Moâ€™s, you can purchase a Gillette x Movember razor pack from @tescofood and, by doing so, you will be making a donation straight into Gilletteâ€™s Movember fund. And, if facial hair isnâ€™t your thing, there are plenty of other ways to do your bit. If you or any man in your life has ever struggled with their mental health, youâ€™ll know how crucial it is. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m part of this campaign. Head to Movember.com/Gillette to get involved.",

jimchapman,"SHAVE DOWN FOR MENTAL HEALTHAd You might have seen on my page that Iâ€™m an ambassador for @GilletteUKâ€™s partnership with @Movember this year and Iâ€™m super proud to be supporting such a worthwhile cause. So, hereâ€™s how we can help change the face of menâ€™s mental health: join me, shave down and Mo up this Movember to help support our frontline workers â€“ itâ€™s simple to sign up at Movember.com/Gillette. There are loads of fun ways you can get involved but perhaps the easiest is by buying a special Gillette x Movember razor pack from @tescofood where one pack = one donation. It doesnâ€™t matter what your Mo looks like (all Moâ€™s welcome â€“ though I do have high hopes for mine), the important thing is that as many people as possible get involved because every Mo will raise awareness, it will raise funds, it will start a conversation and it may even save a life. All through November, @GilletteUK will be raising awareness and funds for @Movember which this year, is more important than ever because the money raised will support the mental health of our key workers - the heroes who have kept us going during the pandemic. Itâ€™s time for us to look after them. I know this is something we all care deeply, so Iâ€™m challenging you to put your tash where your mouth is! Gentlemen, start your razors.

This fight for a better, decent, kind America isnâ€™t over. Those who voted for Trump will find another version of him, within the next 4 years, who will encourage their racist, homophobic, transphobic, Islamaphobic beliefs.

sophiekasaei_,"LAST LOCKDOWN INSPO --If youve followed me for a while you will know that last lockdown I really took advantage of having time off and working on myself. The way the world was really did affect my mental health, like others all my worked stopped , the news terrified me and I really had extreme anxiety and worry. So my way of release was to wake up everyday , make my bed and put on some gym wear. That way I had to start with some fitness. Wether that was 10 mins or a hour it was my way of forgetting the world and zoning out. This also helped mentally and obv course it physically changed my appearance! -Secondly I found my love for cooking again, as most of you watched I did live cook offs and also filmed content on my IGTV which felt so amazing that you all followed and tried out! -I started reading inspirational books - THE MAGIC- was my fave! I also meditated day and night. -Also please if anyone like me lives alone and is worried about feeling lonely or sad go have some social time in your support bubble! -I just want all my followers who I love to stay safe this lockdown and try take some time for yourself. Iâ€™m taking these next few weeks to try get back to the place I was in this photo. Follow my new business venture @skunmasked as all will be revealed soon how to mentally and physically change your way of life.

sonyaesman,"""How do you deal with anxiety?"" I've been asked this question countless times throughout the years, yet my answer is always the same. If I feel anxiety building out of nowhere, I literally put on my shoes, lock the door, and WALK. You don't need a set route or speed; flow through it. My best advice is to walk to do an errand - or have a destination in mind that you'd need to go to regardless. Moving through the physical body is incredibly cleansing, especially if you've felt trapped in your mind. If you walked instead of drove a car to the grocery store every day, imagine how much you'd be reducing your carbon footprint. And beyond that, how much stronger and more empowered you would feel in your shoes- which I have to give words of love and respect to @avrelife for. Thank you for making the most mind-blowingly sustainable exercise gear- and these gorgeous sneakers. When in doubt, walk it out :) ",#lifeinAVRE #AVREambassador

sonyaesman,*laughs in hysteric gemini*a little bedroom DIY transformation thread below â˜ï¸ğŸŒ¹â˜ï¸ the curtain canopy â˜ï¸I handmade a ,"#canopy from 8â€™ birch tree poles I bought on amazon (donâ€™t ask how many sleepless nights i spent googling where to buy a tree pole...), spray painted them in white chalk spray paint, cut them to size with a saw, and then wrapped the ends of the poles in hemp rope. To secure them to the ceiling, I drilled 2 holes at the ends of my bed, drilled in an anchor, and then screwed in a brass coated screw hook on all 4 ends of the bed. I Found LINEN *MUSLIN* curtains on Etsy, *iâ€™m obsessed with soft linen muslin so yes they were expensive af but nonetheless, so perfect, the seller on Etsy was LUMIOstudio* and finally I hung 2 curtains on each birch pole. Bali, who? â˜ï¸ venetian plastering the walls â˜ï¸by far the most physically exhausting and expensive investment iâ€™ve made into this house. BUT. I wake up every morning in love. Check out my IG highlights â€œHOMEâ€ to see some behind the scenes of how it all went down.  Left in its raw state, plaster is an environmentally sound natural materialâ€”breathable, and free of chemicals and VOCs. (It does run you dry of $1,200 per 100sq. ft. though. So I did do a couple of walls myself before hiring a professional because your girl was TIRED and famished). #Venetianplaster is a wall and ceiling finish consisting of plaster mixed with marble dust, applied with a trowel in thin, multiple layers, which are then burnished to create a smooth surface with the illusion of depth and texture. I used @clayamerican and @meodedpaint â˜ï¸ furniture â˜ï¸my house is small yo. itâ€™s a bungalow. when I moved out of my last loft (which came furnished) in #Venice, I only had a bed to my name. this wooden modern loft bed was a big investment a few years ago but forever timeless (from @modloft). The rest of the stuff in here is ikea dressers that have all broken apart....so...thereâ€™s that lol. ğŸŒ¹â˜ï¸ lmk if you guys have any technical questions.

Building the house during the winter last year and then during a world pandemic has been a challenge to say the least and massively delayed things but finally the end is near. Iâ€™ve fallen in love with interior design and renovating and I canâ€™t wait to flip more houses with Myles in the near future! We had no project manager or interior designer to help us, Myles managed the build himself whilst balancing a full time job and I designed the house all by myself literally just by using Pinterest inspiration and Instagram so weâ€™re feeling pretty proud of ourselves!

kristenmcatee,"I came up with this tattoo during a therapy session a few months ago. If youâ€™re in therapy, you know those moments where something just clicks and you feel like you almost leveled up in a video game - it was one of those moments. I described myself as â€œstrategically impulsiveâ€ and my therapist laughed and said, â€œthatâ€™s very contradicting but completely makes sense for youâ€. I am strategically impulsive because when brought to a situation where I need to make a decision, I can make it quickly in a way that seems impulsive but recognize which decision will be the best in the long run. I trust my intuition so much because itâ€™s never let me down and I encourage others to trust their gut always. So I got a neck tattoo which seems very impulsive but fuck it because nothing matters anyway lol",

kristenmcatee,"Iâ€™ve recently been talking about my Endometriosis more and more, and you guys have made me feel so much better about it. I know there are so many women in our boat, and I really do want to start using my platform to talk about it more. Hormonal contraceptives have never worked well with my body, so Iâ€™ve always just accepted that I canâ€™t be on birth control. Until I found @naturalcycles , I was so relieved there was a natural option for me but was still skeptical until I researched more and talked to my doctor. This is the first and only FDA cleared birth control app that can help you prevent or plan pregnancy. Every morning I take my temperature and the thermometer has a second decimal place that is able to accurately measure the rise and fall of my temperature day to day. plug it into the app, and this helps determine where you are in ovulation aka if you can get pregnant or not. This is also SOOO helpful for me because my doctor has me keeping track of my ovulation every month to monitor my endometriosis. This is 98% effective when used perfectly and 93% effective with typical use. If you want to join me you can go to Naturalcycles.com for 20% off an annual subscription + a free thermometer with my code ""kristenmcatee""I feel like Iâ€™ve been able to understand my menstrual cycle so much more than ever before. Why arenâ€™t we taught about this more?? Blows my mind. Women are literally magical life makers lolp.s. - Natural Cycles does not protect from STIâ€™s so still use protection guys! You also must be 18+ ",#ad

evachen212,"I just spent the last two hours trying to find my favorite picture of Otto, who passed away tonight. In the picture he has a flower crown (!) and is smiling and you can see what a gentle soul he was. I adopted Otto when he was four months old. When I met him for the first time, he immediately darted under my legs and the owner at the time said thatâ€™s how she knew I was The One. Otto had terrible separation anxiety because of his previous foster homes, he never really got over it... but we just let him go everywhere with us instead. Otto was nearly 17 years when he passed. He was there for the early days of my relationship with Tom, he was a patient old soul with Ren and Tao who dressed him up and poked and prodded him, and he loved our family so much and us him.

sbahle_mpisane,MHBOT works by taking oxygen from a concentrated source and delivering it to you via a long plastic tube in connection to your oxygen mask ,"#OxygenatedÂ The reason why it works so well is because itâ€™s under pressure which enables the body to pick up,absorb and  transport more oxygen throughout your body. The air that comes from your oxygen source contains a much higher percentage of oxygen than the air you breathe normally.Your lungs then transfer this oxygen to your blood, where it gets pumped around your body so your different cells and organs can use it. By using supplemental oxygen, you ensure that there's enough oxygen available to meet your body's needsâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”For #BlackFriday specials, call @oxygenate_durban on â€”> 0733996238 to join the fam or visit the link on my bio"

brandicyrus,"Every 1.2 seconds, humans destroy an area of forest the size of a football field. That means 80,000 acres of forests disappear from the earth every single day. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m proud to partner with @Aspiration and join the ","#plantyourchange movement to plant a tree with every purchase. Places like where Iâ€™m standing here are becoming more and more scarce, and our planet cannot survive if this rate of deforestation continues. While you may not feel the personal effects of this right now depending on where you live, itâ€™s really only a matter of time before you do.A quick google search will you show you that the climate crisis is here - from the wildfires that burnt my sisterâ€™s Malibu home to the ground in 2019, to the hurricanes (yes, plural) that are literally right this moment slamming an already under water & storm ravaged Central Americaâ€¦ it hits closer and closer to home. The villages in Honduras where Iâ€™ve volunteered with @humanityandhope have been completely devastated over these past two weeks, and itâ€™s insanely heart breaking.These disasters leave tens of thousands of people homeless, and while it may seem overwhelming to know where to even begin to help, Aspiration and @plantyourchange have created a way where we can contribute to fighting the climate crisis at itâ€™s roots, literally. For each of the card purchases youâ€™re already making, a tree can be planted with just your spare change! Join me at PlantYourChange.com to connect your credit or debit card to #plantyourchange - this will round up every purchase you make to the nearest dollar and use the change to plant a new tree! (And itâ€™s super easy to pause or set a max limit on how much you donate)Creating change is daunting, but if we do this together we can make a major positive impact on the global climate crisis. I recognize that #plantyourchange will not solve things alone, but itâ€™s a starting point where a little bit of change could go a long way. It will help offset our personal carbon footprint to make a better future for us and our planet. Check the link in my bio for more info & how to sign up, and tell them our friends! Thereâ€™s power is numbers & change IS possible! ğŸŒ³ â¤ï¸"

sophiathomalla,"Alle sind immer so wahnsinnig schnell mit ihrer Posterei und noch abends rufen Medien an, was man denn jetzt dazu sagt und warum nicht gleich sondern morgen. Ich brauch erstmal paar Minuten um zu realisieren, um dann auch reagieren zu koÌˆnnen. Ich kannte Udo uÌˆber 17 Jahre, nicht der Post bei Instagram ist das Mindeste, sondern die stillschweigenden Minuten, die man intensiv an ihn denkt. Er hat mir meinen aller aller ersten Fotomodel Job gegeben, wo er mir mit der Schere in die Haare geschnitten hat und sagte: â€so! Die Haare muÌˆssen jetzt ab. Lang hat jeder und du bist nicht jederâ€œ Das habe ich zwar ein halbes Jahr lang nicht verdaut, ğŸ˜‚ befreundet waren wir dennoch seitdem. Ich werde seine laute Art, sein Lachen, seine weisen RatschlaÌˆge, seine grenzenlose Liebe zu Tieren und seine Warmherzigkeit sehr vermissen. Mit seinem Tod geht ein weiterer Mensch, der vom Scheitel bis zur Sohle einfach guÌˆtig, groÃŸzuÌˆgig und loyal war. Und davon gibt es in der Branche einfach immer weniger. Ich hab von ihm so viel gelernt und mitgenommen. Mit ihm stirbt ein Teil von Berlin und ein Teil von mir. So wie ich den Mittelfinger von Rudi gelernt hab, so habe ich seine flapsige Art von ihm. Er hat sich immer ins Restaurant gesetzt und den Kellner gefragt: â€Kennen sie mich?â€œ Wenn der Herr  mit â€neinâ€œ antwortete, sagte Udo immer: â€das ist schlechtâ€œ! Zurecht! Ich mach das ab heute auch so!!Meine Gedanken sind zutiefst bei Carsten!",

adelina.pestritu,"Asa cum v-am promis, astazi revin cu detalii despre cum puteti participa la licitatia pentru rochia de mireasa @pronovias .Scopul licitatiei este unul caritabil, asadar va rog sa cititi cu atentie acest text. Orasul in care m-am nascut imi trezeste multe amintiri frumoase si mereu il voi numi â€œacasaâ€. Acum a venit momentul sa ii ofer o mana de ajutor ca el sa se pastreze mereu frumos, viu si adaptat zilelor noastre. Sectia de Pediatrie a Spitalului Municipal Campulung-Muscel, acolo unde m-am nascut, este neschimbata. Anii au trecut, medicina si tehnologia au avansat, insa spitalul, in care atat de multi copii isi cunosc mamele, a ramas pe loc. Si stiu ca alaturi de alti oameni cu inima mare il putem transforma intr-un spatiu cald si primitor pentru bebelusii si copiii fiecarei familii. Un prim pas este sÄƒ-mi scot la licitaÈ›ie rochia mea de mireasÄƒ, iar banii sÄƒ serveascÄƒ la recondiÈ›ionarea acestei SecÈ›ii de Pediatrie a spitalului unde eu am venit pe lume, urmÃ¢nd ca implicarea mea sÄƒ fie mereu activÄƒ Ã®n aceastÄƒ campanie frumoasÄƒ.Licitatia a pornit ieri de la suma simbolica de 500Ron, iar astazi este deja la 10.000Ron. Pretul real al rochiei a fost de 8.800â‚¬, insa cea care pana vineri va licita suma cea mai mare, va putea intra in posesia ei, iar banii vor servi cauzei nobile despre care tocmai v-am spus. Accesati link ul din BIO pentru a va  putea inscrie la licitatie. â™¥ï¸ ğŸ‘°ğŸ» â€¢ Licitatia este deschida publicului mediului online si este organizata de Asociatia La Primul Bebe, care  sprijina informational si emotional gravidele si mamele din Romania, in primii ani dupa nastere. Acest sprijin este oferit in comunitatile online, prin Sistemul National de Sprijin pentru Mame BebeBunVenit, dar si prin licitatiile pe care asociatia le organizeaza de numai 2 ori pe an. In ultimii 8 ani de zile LaPrimulBebe a strans in campaniile sale umanitare 1.700.000 EUR, bani cu care a finantat si implementat o serie de proiecte pentru beneficiul mamelor si copiilor din Romania. Este singura comunitate din Romania premiata de Facebook USA si numita una dintre cele mai de impact 100 comunitati din lume. â™¥ï¸ğŸ‘°ğŸ»",

In cazul meu tinand cont de durerile lombare pe care le am de cativa ani, am facut un research atunci cand a trebuit sa aleg salteaua patului in care dorm gandindu-ma in primul rand la sanatate, apoi la starea de bine pe care trebuie sa o am atunci cand stau in pat. Inainte ca medicul meu sa-mi spuna ca  60% dintre durerile de spate sunt provocate de dormitul pe saltele nepotrivite, n-am dat prea mare importanta si am cumparat produse fara sa iau in calcul avantajele &  dezavantajele lor. Acum insa, mi-am dat seama ca este nevoie sa tin cont de aceste aspecte iar prietenii mei de la @imperialuxuryhome mi-au recomandat salteaua de la Dorelan, un brand renumit cu produse de super calitate despre care am aflat ca este prezent in toata Europa si foarte apreciat si in SUA. Salteaua Reactive este prima saltea din lume proiectata stiintific si este recomandata si sportivilor si imbunatatirii performantei acestora. ",#qualitysleep #wellbeing @dorelanitalia

lolowood_,"Just wanted to write about something thatâ€™s been on my mind. With world mental health day just passing, Iâ€™ve been reading about & exploring Self care & self love. Iâ€™ll be the first to say the main thing I struggle with most in life is procrastination. I have so many things I want to get done but I find myself attacking items in a way where Iâ€™m more busy than productive after a long days work. Itâ€™s important we identify our shortcomings and address the root of the problem. I saw a quote that read: Ego says, â€œOnce everything falls into place, I'll feel peace.â€ Spirit says, â€œFind your peace, and then everything will fall into placeâ€ -Marianne Williamson. This puts a whole lot into perspective because it stresses the Importance of making your spirit THE priority which IS self care and self love ! God is LOVE. It all starts with that. ğŸŒº",

Adesso ne ho venti e posso dire che in quattro anni ho capito lâ€™importanza delle virgolette.Ancora mi ricordo la prima notte passata qui. Essendo abituata alla periferia, quasi campagna e a vivere in una strada senza uscita non riuscivo proprio a chiudere occhio e tra me e me pensavo â€œse mai un giorno dovessi lontanamente riuscirci con la recitazione farÃ² avanti e indietro tutti i giorni, io unâ€™altra notte qui non ce la passoâ€. Nessuno perÃ² mi aveva detto che a distanza di due anni avrei passato piÃ¹ notti a Roma che a casa mia. Non sono mai riuscita chiamare â€œcasa miaâ€ un posto che non fosse casa mia. Dâ€™altronde, â€œcasa miaâ€ Ã¨ casa mia. Adesso sono a casa mia, a Roma, e quando i miei amici mi chiedono â€œdove dormi?â€ Io, con un sorriso stampato in faccia, rispondo: a casa mia.",
jennydenucci,"Non metto in dubbio che lâ€™ultimo periodo sia stato particolare, non metto metto nemmeno in dubbio che mi abbia fatto piÃ¹ bene che male.Io ho sempre bisogno di ricrearmi, giorno per giorno, io oggi posso essere attrice, domani voglio essere astronauta e cosÃ¬ via per sempre. Credo molto nella consequenzialitÃ  degli avvenimenti, del momento giusto al posto giusto, che nulla accada per caso, ma che molte cose si facciano per scelta perchÃ©, diciamocelo, davanti a un bivio scegliamo noi quale strada prendere.Io penso che tutto abbia consequenzialitÃ  perchÃ© non Ã¨ un caso se qualcuno esce dalla tua vita in un momento ben definito, e non Ã¨ nemmeno un caso che tu ti metta a lottare contro il tempo e contro la pioggia, perchÃ© diciamocelo il sole piace a tutti ma ad aspettare sotto le nuvole restano in pochi.Che poi mi sono sempre chiesta che cosa avrei pensato a 20anni e questa cosa del pensare mi fa davvero incazzare ma sono ancora piÃ¹ incazzata quando finiscono gli argomenti e allora mi forzo piÃ¹ che posso al fine di trovarne altri e poi chiudo in me stessa perchÃ© a volte anche la tua stessa mente puÃ² farti paura ma non puoi fermarla. Io credo a molte cose, io credo che il 3 mi abbia sempre portato fortuna, credo lâ€™arte puÃ² salvarti la giornata, credo che il pollo con il curry sia una bomba e credo che niente accada per caso.Ma soprattutto credo che tutti i nodi vengano sempre al pettine, che le cose alla fine vanno come devono andare e il caso non salverÃ  nessuno, anzi, lo condannerÃ  se ci sarÃ  la possibilitÃ .E mi sono rotta le palle perchÃ© io ho voglia di sperimentare, ho il diritto rifarlo e di rifarlo finchÃ© non mi viene la nausea. Credo fortemente che non ci sia nulla che non vada dei periodi no, diffidate da chi vi dice il contrario, da chi scambia il benessere psicologico con lâ€™idealizzazione di una positivitÃ  tossica che giorno per giorno sta rovinando questa generazione. I periodi no fanno parte di noi, anche provando a superarli con tutta la forza permettendo. Non sentitevi sbagliati solo perchÃ© qualcuno vi fa credere che la positivitÃ  sua un sorriso plastico stampato in faccia 24/7. Vogliatevi bene. Giorno per giorno, partendo dalle piccole cose.",

diipakhosla,"DUALITY OF A WOMANA little backstory about these photos is that when I did this shoot on the 4th, my mom was celebrating Karwa Chauth at home. Believe it or not, without knowing or telling each other anything, we both took these exact same photos around the same time. Mother- daughter telepathy, donâ€™t you think?Aside from the coincidence, these two photos hold so much beauty and sincerity in my eyes. My mom has always taught and shown me two facets of a woman. She always told me that a woman could hold great bravery, fierceness, strength and all the power in the world, all in just her eyes. Simultaneously, have this vulnerable side showing how spiritual she is or how grounded and humble she can still be, whilst holding her power. That being said, I grew up believing that thatâ€™s exactly what a woman should be and aspire to be: a well rounded being, proudly representing her duality of power and humility in moments where itâ€™s necessary . Something I get told almost everyday, is how much I resemble my mom... what an honor that is. Looking at these photos, I feel closer than ever with the woman who Iâ€™ve always considered my role model and has taught me how to stand  independently and proud to this day. I need only not be her, but instead to be the woman she has raised me to become with all the encouragement, support and everlasting love. â¤ï¸ @sangithakhosla",

It has three essential ceramides to maintain the protective skin barrier and amazing acne fighting ingredients like 4% Benzoyl Peroxide that works wonders to help clear acne and prevent new acne, without stripping my skin of its moisture!

vanessagrimaldi30,"No Better YouIf you are new to my page, welcome! My name is Vanessa and I was on @bachelorabc a few years ago. During my hometown date, I went to visit my students at @galileoadultcentre  As a special education teacher, I wanted to give my students visibility and let the world see their ABILITIES.This time last year, I was surrounded by my closest friends who helped my non-profit @nobetteryou win $25,000 at a @hudsonsbay gift wrapping contest. Long story short, I started a non-profit called No Better You while my season was airing. If you are a teacher or parent, you understand the need to have access to resources, especially in the special education community. No Better You's mission is to help schools with special education programs build and have access to sensory rooms! Since 2017, we've raised $150,000 and helped 4 schools in Montreal build their very own sensory room.A sensory room is a therapeutic space designed to promote a calming and soothing experience. It relieves stress, facilitates communication and social interaction, increases focus and attention, promotes mental and physical relaxation and provides a safe place for students to explore and interact with their environment.After speaking and visiting a few schools in and around Toronto, No Better You selected @aptustreatmentcentre as the recipient of the $25,000! I am SO excited to be able to help a school in Ontario and hopefully one day be able to help out schools across Canada and the United States! ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸Thank you @taymocha @jbrwolfe @zachinthewild @caityoconnor @juliarakk @adrianainglesi @hudsonsbay and thank you @navbhatiasuperfan for taking a photo with me!!!!!!!!!! â¤ï¸ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦",#nonprofit #specialeducation #school #contestwinner

Salah satunya adalah mengenai metode persalinan secara Caesar yang ternyata bisa memberikan dampak pada imunitas Si Kecil, karena Si Kecil tidak terpapar bakteri baik yang ada di jalan lahir Mama. ..Eits tapi Mama ga perlu khawatir...sebab pemulihan imunitas Si Kecil bisa dilakukan dengan pemberian ASI. Karena ASI mengandung prebiotik dan probiotik yang kombinasinya dikenal dengan sinbiotik, yang bisa menjaga keseimbangan bakteri baik di usus sehingga imunitas Si Kecil menjadi kuat ğŸ’ªğŸ»..Informasi lengkap mulai dari kehamilan hingga persalinan semua ada di C-Ready Page by @nutriclub_id (http://bit.ly/SiapLewatiCaesar).

aliciasilverstone,"Told you all my dogs love veggies! ğŸ˜‰ğŸ¥• I saw a lot of discussion in my comments on a photo of Pinto Bean from months ago in front of a plate of carrots. For those asking, that food wasnâ€™t for him (my friend just happened to snap a quick pic cause it was so cute!). My dogs do however have a vegan diet. I started giving my dogs a vegan diet about 20 years ago. Iâ€™ve had 7 dogs before this bunch and they were all HUGE dogs. Iâ€™m talking 50 pounds and bigger, and each of them died around the average age of 16 (very unusual btw for big dogs to live that long given mainstream diets). Before some of you start flooding the comments with opinions, just know they stopped getting fleas, hot spots, and their coats became beautiful when their diet switched to vegan. By the way, the carrot makes a nice snack for a teething puppy - it soothes his teeth, keeps him busy munching, and is nourishing with vitamins! ğŸ˜‚ If youâ€™re curious to learn more on why I give them a 100% plant-based diet, I talk about it in my blog on ",#TheKindLife at TheKindLife.com (or swipe up in my story!).

lucavezil,"Gym is my happy place, it is a fact. When Iâ€™m motivated or when Iâ€™m sad, when I need to focus on myself or when I need to blow off steam, when I need time to think or when I have a spare hour, the gym is the place I go. But building my own place, bit by bit, is something else. One of my goals for the next future is to open my own gym, that doesnâ€™t aim to be only a gym, but itâ€™s not what Iâ€™m here talking about today. Having my own home/basement gym in this period means more than some weights in a room as I already told you during the past lockdown, and those who know those â€œgym vibesâ€ can easily understand what I mean. I lot of you asked me whatâ€™s the basic equipment they should get, where I bought all my stuff and whatâ€™s the average price for building a small yet functional home gym. Well, probably because I spend a lot of time there, probably because I was bored, probably because Iâ€™m actually proud of what I built with my two hands, surely because I want to show you more about it, I decided @basement_39 needed to have its own space on the gram. Day by day, I will show and explain the equipment I have, the basic one you should have (not only weights), where to find it plus the average price, some tips to build your own home/basement/garage/garret gym and some home-workout inspo.

lucavezil,"There are two sentences about travelling I always keep in my mind: â€œTravel is the only thing you buy that makes you richerâ€ and â€œWhen you come back from a travel, you are never the same person who leftâ€. Truer words have never been spoken.I feel blessed I could travel and visit many countries in the past years, each of which left me something that helped me building the person I am today. People, landscapes, cultures, food and any experience you live leave you something youâ€™ll bring forever deep inside. It was hard to choose only ten pictures to sum up all the memories I made through all my travels but having spent the last hour searching through dozens of photos and videos let me time travel and realise I want to travel more, visit more, discover more, learn more, meet more people and make many more memories. I need it. I promise myself Iâ€™ll do it as much as possible once weâ€™ll be able to travel again, soon ğŸ—ºHere are the photos I chose:1. Telalalang rice terrace, Ubud, Bali 20152.

meryturiel,"LA TEORIÌA DE LOS TRES PILARES La compartioÌ conmigo una persona muy especial para miÌ en una de esas tardes en las que de las canÌƒas te pasas a las copas y se te empieza a liar el asunto. Y con ello, empiezas a filosofar como si te fuese la vida en ello. Y de repente me la soltoÌ como quien no quiere la cosa. Y se ha quedado conmigo para siempre. MaÌs que una teoriÌa, se podriÌa decir que se trata de una filosofiÌa de vida que he adoptado como miÌa y que me ha ayudado en muchos momentos. Y como dicen que compartir es vivir, voy a explicarla para que si alguien en un momento malo, se acuerda de ella, pueda ayudarle. Y sereÌ la persona maÌs feliz del mundo. En realidad es sencilla, pero a veces las mejores cosas lo son. Se trata de tener tres pilares fundamentales en tu vida sobre los que apoyarte. Por ejemplo, tu trabajo o carrera, tu entorno y una aficioÌn con la que disfrutes mucho. Y la clave estaÌ en ir combinaÌndolas de manera que esteÌn lo maÌs equilibradas posible. Creo que es un error centrar tu vida en un uÌnico pilar que la sostenga, porque cuando ese pilar se derrumbe, tuÌ lo haraÌs con eÌl. Si lo uÌnico para lo que vives es tu pareja, si de un diÌa para otro eÌsta decide marcharse, tu vida se derrumbaraÌ. Si lo uÌnico para lo que vives es para tu trabajo, si de un diÌa para otro lo pierdes, tu vida se derrumbaraÌ. Mientras que si vas dando saltitos de un pilar a otro, cuando pierdas a alguien querido, o sientas ganas de mandar a la mierda a tu jefe, tendraÌs otras cosas en las cuales refugiarte. Y si fallan los tres pilares busca otros de nuevo. El cambio es la uÌnica constante en este vida. Y asiÌ voy yo por la vida desde ese diÌa, dando saltitos de un sitio a otro, buscando ser lo maÌs feliz posible e intentando construir una vida de la cual no necesite un descanso ğŸ–¤ texto Mery Turiel",

meryturiel,"El paso de los aÃ±os trae muchas cosas. Algunas son malas no nos vamos a engaÃ±ar. A mi me han traÃ­do desilusiones, despedidas, reproches o decepciones. TambiÃ©n me han traÃ­do muchÃ­simas cosas buenas. Los desengaÃ±os amorosos me llevaron a saber lo que querÃ­a, pero sobre todo lo que no querÃ­a en mi vida. Las decepciones te ayudan a aprender aunque sea de una manera triste y te hacen valorar las personas que sÃ­ que merecen llevar la palabra amigo consigo. Pero de todo, lo mejor que me han dejado los aÃ±os ha sido el conocerme mucho mejor. Y por consecuencia, respetarme y quererme. Desde pequeÃ±a he sido un persona solitaria. Sin experiencia y no entendiÃ©ndome bien, pensaba que era una rarita, un poco asocial y que yo era la diferente al resto de personas. Con los aÃ±os he comprendido que esos ratos que necesito para mÃ­ son oro. Que forman parte de lo que soy y que son tan respetables como las personas que necesitan siempre estar rodeadas. Me hace feliz disfrutar de momentos a solas leyendo, viendo una peli o descubriendo cafeterÃ­as y rincones nuevos. Conocernos nos evita hacer cosas que nos producen infelicidad.

En este caso paso a ser maÌs un tema meÌdico que de belleza. Gracias Doc por cuidar cada detalle y hacerme sentir segura!!! Gracias tambieÌn a mi amigos  y doc @liliandemarchi y @drchsaizar por aconsejarme a realizar este procedimiento. Consultar con los meÌdicos siempre tranquiliza.

I figure if she and I had that common, a lot of other people probably do too or will in the future. I think others may be able to learn from our missteps before getting married (or feel less alone in having made them), and for that reason I think this episode is especially important to listen to. we also talk about how we met working at The Tin Palace in college, divorce parties, and her brand @muffmasque (yes, itâ€™s a mask for your vagina)! ğŸ’• the episode is live at the link in my bio or anywhere you listen to your podcasts!!",

Sangrar no nos hace dÃ©biles. 2. Que por ser mujer debemos ser madres, no es cierto. 3. Definir los colores, los gustos, la ropa segÃºn el sexo es una locura. 4. Que las mujeres tambiÃ©n tenemos pelos, es una realidad, no importa a quien moleste.5. Que es â€œegoÃ­staâ€ que una mamÃ¡ salga sin sus hijos, ella tambiÃ©n necesita tiempo para estar sola y disfrutar. 6. EstrÃ­as y celulitis, lo mÃ¡s natural del mundo. 7. Que cuerpo flaco es sinÃ³nimo de cuerpo lindo y cuerpo gordo es sinÃ³nimo de cuerpo feo, solo importa el cuerpo sano y amado por una misma. 8. Que solo las mujeres tomen anticonceptivos, se hace de a dos o no se hace. 9. Juzgar el cuerpo de los demÃ¡s, solo te perjudicas a ti mismo.  Bueno, son muchos los estigmas que podrÃ­amos escribir, pero lo mÃ¡s importante es poder conversarlos, trabajarlos y darnos cuenta cÃ³mo podemos agregar nuestro granito de arena como personas para convertirnos en nuestra mejor versiÃ³n.

However my whole feed is filled with Armenian propaganda, and since we have so little representation in Los Angeles, especially knowing that this place is basically ruled by Armenians, I canâ€™t be silent and let them takeover the narrative, and twist it, however they want. And even though I have nothing against Armenian people (regular people are not to be blamed for the choices of their government), I do think itâ€™s not fair. Just because their voice is louder, doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s always true. I really wanted to stay out of this, because I do not support war, I simply want to include these bullet points (swipe right) that explain the situation clearly and hopefully spread some light on what is happening between two countries (these are not my words,but I think It is very accurate).

Tomorrow, Tori will be taking over my IG stories to talk about that and so much more. Keep an eye out for this one! You might just learn something. xx",

Come si beve il caffÃ¨.Il tempo che stiamo vivendo (questo secondo tempo direi, prevedibile come il finale di un film davvero banale per il quale lasciare la sala prima dei titoli di coda sarebbe un gesto di rispetto) ci vede, e forse ci vedrÃ , divisi tra gli ansiosi che isseranno muri contro la socialitÃ  e gli smaniosi di vivere che si caricheranno di rabbia per non poterlo fare.In questo tempo una (ci si prova) lucida autoanalisi per non ritrovarsi ai lati estremi e creare guerre psicologiche e civili Ã¨ tutto quello che dobbiamo fare. Rimanere saldi e provare a rimodellarci sulle forme (strette e storte) che ci ritroviamo a riempire Ã¨ forse un modo per uscirne meno ammaccati.Il mio pensiero va ai tantissimi che stanno subendo di piÃ¹ questa pandemia (che sia per la malattia, per il contesto familiare, per il lavoro, per lâ€™etÃ ...) ... temo per i piÃ¹ deboli sotto ogni punto di vista.Speriamo che le nostre scelte future, anche quelle politiche, abbiano memoria di questo tempo.Con amoreL...",#levantecanta#levantecaos#levantemagma

This allows you to keep your workouts entertaining AND effective..3ï¸âƒ£ MOVE IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR YOUItâ€™s okay to rest or move in a different way (EVEN IF you consider yourself a â€œweightlifterâ€ / â€œbodybuilderâ€ / or whatever labels we like).

abby,"MISS THIS? â˜¹ï¸ğŸ‘ Try This!.Kinda crazy but itâ€™s been over SIX MONTHS since Iâ€™ve been in a gym and Iâ€™mâ€¦loving it?! ğŸ˜µ Yes. Actually. These past few months my training style has completely changed. Iâ€™m still doing the same compound movements I would in the gym, but modified to be challenging with the limited weights I have..The barbell hip thrust is one of THE BEST moves you can do for glutes ğŸ’ªğŸ‘. HOWEVER if you only have a couple dumbbells, it can be difficult to get the same results with plain ol hip thrusts at home. So Iâ€™ve got some more challenging variations for you!.1ï¸âƒ£Dead Stop Thrust Swing - starting from a glutes stretched mechanically disadvantaged position requires a greater force to get out âš¡ï¸. Explosive tempo forces you to activate those muscle fibers that would typically only be activated on heavy lifts like barbell hip thrusts ğŸ‘..2ï¸âƒ£Hybrid Kneeling Thrust - this feels like a hybrid of a kneeling hip thrust and a glute ham raise â€” one of the best exercises to challenge your hamstrings and glutes without a lot of weight ğŸ”¥. This requires a lot of control but when done correctly creates HUGE stretch in your hams and glutes on the lower. So start bodyweight, then work your way up from there!.3ï¸âƒ£Single Leg Kneeling Thrust - weâ€™re shifting all the emphasis to one side to increase difficulty, using the non-working leg (leg out to the side) to stabilize so you can sit back as far as possible ğŸ‘. I like doing this at a quicker tempo to keep constant tension on the glutes throughout the range of motion..All of these exercises are based off the kneeling thrust - basically a hip thrust rotated around so you donâ€™t need a bench. Subtle adjustments in form and tempo and youâ€™ve got yourself a great glute workout. Oh and btw donâ€™t underestimate these. Theyâ€™re harder than they look ğŸ˜°ğŸ™.

dentistasfit,"NÃ£o Ã© fÃ¡cil.Por muito tempo eu nÃ£o consegui foco no meu trabalho porque sÃ³ tinha cabeÃ§a pra ela. Ela nÃ£o pedia por isso, mas eu nÃ£o havia ainda aprendido a desapegar, a andar com â€œminhas prÃ³prias pernasâ€. A entender que eu precisava me sentir tambÃ©m, importante, ativa, Ãºtil. Louco e contraditÃ³rio, nÃ©? Isso martelou por diversas vzs na minha cabeÃ§a, eu achava que deixando-a em casa estaria sendo menos mae. Se eu nÃ£o tivesse participando do almoÃ§o dela, vendo se dormiu bem as sonecas, se tÃ¡ de bom humor ou se tÃ¡ incomodada com algo, eu seria menos mae. Mas engraÃ§ado que ao mesmo tempo, eu me culpava por nÃ£o conseguir â€œcontrolarâ€ se ela sairia do peito ou nÃ£o, se ela estava comendo bem ou nÃ£o, se ela dormia bem ou nÃ£o.. Eu nÃ£o tinha percebido que na maternidade nÃ³s nÃ£o temos controle de absolutamente nada. Eu centralizava tudo. Na minha cabeÃ§a eu precisava estar ali, presente. Afinal, nÃ£o sonhei tanto com ela? Como ficaria horas distante? Mas o que eu nÃ£o tinha percebido era que para eu ser uma boa mÃ£e, eu precisaria estar bem comigo mesma antes de qualquer coisa. Tenho um perfil extremamente ativo, que nÃ£o para, que Ã© intenso, que se joga, que corre atrÃ¡s. E me encontrar absolutamente parada estava me deixando com a auto estima lÃ¡ embaixo, nÃ£o me sentia Ãºtil e isso estava me corroendo. Foi aos pouquinhos, dei tempo para o meu lado mae coruja entender que a mÃ£e profissional tambÃ©m precisava de um cantinho. Entendi que a qualidade Ã© melhor que o tempo que passamos juntas. Entendi que minha mÃ£e sÃ³ amamentou atÃ© os 6meses e precisou voltar a trabalhar cedo e nem por isso foi menos mae, pelo contrÃ¡rio, tenho orgulho da mÃ£e foda que ela sempre foi e de como sempre correu atrÃ¡s para nos dar o melhor dentro das condiÃ§Ãµes que vivia. EntÃ£o porque eu temia? Eu quero ser lembrada com orgulho pela Maria e sei que ela compreende que a mamÃ£e precisa trabalhar, mas que volta pra brincar e cuidar dela. E hoje, apesar de continuar doendo o coraÃ§Ã£o a cada â€œdespedidaâ€ pela manhÃ£, seguimos com um vÃ­nculo que cresce a cada dia e na melhor fase profissional de uma mÃ£e que apesar de cansada, se sente empoderada por saber que da o seu mÃ¡ximo para tudo e todos ao seu redor. â¤ï¸",

dentistasfit,"Uma das coisas que aprendi ao longo da maternidade foi que nÃ£o nascemos mÃ£e, nos tornamos. A partir do momento que nossos filhos nascem uma nova pessoa tambÃ©m nasce. Ã‰ como se vocÃª tivesse dizendo adeus para tudo aquilo que vocÃª foi e que jamais serÃ¡ novamente. Jamais, imaginem o peso disso? Nunca mais seremos as mesmas, nossas preocupaÃ§Ãµes nunca mais serÃ£o as mesmas, nossas responsabilidades, nossos sonhos, nossa vida, nossos valores. VocÃª pode ser a pessoa mais organizada do mundo mas tenha certeza, alguÃ©m chegou para te desorganizar. VocÃª pode ser extremamente vaidosa mas saiba que pelo menos temporariamente vocÃª nÃ£o vai ligar de ir ao mercado com coque no cabelo, chinelo e moletom. VocÃª pode ser a pessoa mais saudavel do mundo mas as vzs o cansaÃ§o serÃ¡ tanto que tudo bem comer um fast-food.VocÃª pode ter tudo na vida, mas percebe que pra ser feliz sÃ³ precisa de saÃºde, sua e dos seus. Quando me tornei mae achei que logo nos primeiros dias nossa ligaÃ§Ã£o seria imensa, inexplicÃ¡vel. Que eu saberia acalmÃ¡-la imediatamente em meio a aqueles choros incontrolÃ¡veis. Eu nÃ£o sabia, eu nÃ£o sabia mesmo o q fazer. Eu falhava. Eu achava que o problema era comigo por nÃ£o ter nascido junto com a minha filha aquela sabedoria das mÃ£es de novela. Mas eu aprendi que tudo tem um tempo certo e se antes eu chorava junto ouvindo seu choro desesperada por nÃ£o saber o que fazer, hoje sou seu colo, seu abrigo, sua fortaleza. Ah, filha. Como Ã© bom ter vocÃª. Como Ã© bom sentir teus braÃ§os enlaÃ§ando as minhas pernas, suas mÃ£ozinhas tentando me abraÃ§ar por trÃ¡s da nuca.

tiffanyalvord,"ğŸ’­As I was thinking about life, I realized â€”> We are RESILIENT creatures..ğŸ’¥ -I realized with a year as difficult as this, if you persevere, if you keep going.. you WILL move forward. You WILL learn, you WILL grow, you WILL BE stronger. After knowing where I've been emotionally and mentally the last few months, itâ€™s crazy to see and feel what I do now. I feel hopeful, I feel empowered. I feel a level of depth and appreciation and love I havenâ€™t before. It just shows me how we are built for â€”>survival<â€”. â¤ï¸ We're built for connection in the depths of our darkest experiences. We WILL rise up through what we're going through; because time and time again life puts us through the ringer and we make it to the other side. ğŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ -My dad once told me that he thinks we go through these hardships, these losses, betrayal, death, break-ups, dissapointments, downfalls, etc.. because ""it's to prove ourselves; to ourselves and to the heavens."" That we must go through hard things because Jesus went through hard things. And hearing his words, his contentness, his acceptance of the yin & yang of life has really given me a new outlook on how I see trials. I've been reflecting on it a bit and just wanted to share. <3 Note to you: You are stronger than you think. You are capable and brave of so much and your future-self is gonna be so proud of you one day, saying, â€œYES I DID THAT, I got through THAT!â€ ğŸ‘Š So keep on, keepinâ€™ on! â˜ºï¸â¤ï¸",
tiffanyalvord,"Ahhh, I was so nervous to move ğŸ™ˆ BUT I did it! ğŸ‰â˜ºï¸ & Iâ€™m feeling hopeful & excited! - I used @northstarmoving to help & they made the process so much easier. ğŸ˜­ğŸ™ (They moved all the boxes and furniture & took the stress of â€œmovingâ€ away.) Like I legit moved/picked-up one box ğŸ“¦ but then realized they were much quicker & stronger. ğŸ˜… I genuinely admire their talents, haha. ğŸ˜†ğŸ’ªğŸ¼ğŸ‘ŒğŸ’¥ ","#QOTD - have you ever moved?! How was it for you? â¤ï¸-ğŸ’­  P.S. (more thoughts) Iâ€™ve lived at my grandmas the last 5 years (& that home has been in the family for 50 years ) & I have so many memories there. My mom and brother Tevin came to help & it has made it seem a lot less scary. â¤ï¸ Thereâ€™s been sooo many major transitions this year and I thought the only thing â€œleftâ€ or â€œnormalâ€ was my home and my family roots to that. But I realized Iâ€™m actually so excited for the new, and I think a fresh change might be exactly what I need. â¤ï¸ so thank you for all the encouragement & support and Iâ€™m so so thankful for you! #onestepforward"
tiffanyalvord,Today wouldâ€™ve been my dads 63rd birthday so hereâ€™s a Happy Birthday & an I miss you dad. Life will never be the same without you. But weâ€™re celebrating still! ğŸ‰â¤ï¸ ,"#hanginginthere -This year has felt like this vortex of crazy & a blur of impossible emotions to grasp or try to understand. I feel like Iâ€™m floating in a dark abyss just trying to grab anything that is remotely close to something â€œnormalâ€ or â€œstableâ€. My dad rooted me in soooo many ways, most that I didnâ€™t even realize til he wasnâ€™t here (and it became very clear.) He was that constant quiet rock in the background, where no matter what the situation; he always had enough love and a solution to fix any problem. So today I just am thankful for having the kind of dad that will forever inspire me in so many ways. Heâ€™s still teaching me so many lessons i just wish I could talk to him about it all. ğŸ’• #loss #lossofalovedone #iloveyoudad"

tiffanyalvord,"ğŸ’­ Real talk. ğŸ™ƒ The reality is that this year has been extremely hard.. for so many of us. The truth is that social media is only a FRACTION of what actually goes on. Behind every smile, is nights off tears, behind the days I â€œhave it togetherâ€ are the days I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m hanging in there just as much as yâ€™all. ğŸ™ So if you feel like everyone else is thriving hereâ€™s some reality that weâ€™re all just human. Thereâ€™s no easy fix, and for me I just take it day by day slowly getting through it. ğŸ‘Š- Life isnâ€™t black and white and neither are emotions. So whatever youâ€™re going through or struggling with or feeling.. whatever demons youâ€™re facing, KNOW that Iâ€™m right there with you, fighting my own. â¤ï¸âœŠ But one thing I know for sure is â€”> we only see what weâ€™re made of when weâ€™re forced to face the unimaginable. The inner strength we find in the battles we face; theyâ€™ll build us back up; every time we break. â¤ï¸ I love you guys! ",#imherewithyou

bridget,"giveaway! finally sharing my faux tanning tips and giving 10 of youÂ my tried and true absolute favorite products fromÂ @sttropeztan to enter:- follow me andÂ @sttropeztan- tag a friend below (each friend tagged counts as an additional entry)Â - i will pick 5 of you (and one of ur tagged friends to send the products to)- giveaway is internationaltips: 1) exfoliate everything! old tanner, perfume, deodorant. (with a non-oil based exfoliator).2) put a nice amount of @sttropeztan prep and maintain body moisturizer on your hands, elbows, knees, and feet. you want these areas to be extra hydrated. (warning: most moisturizers are oil based and your new tan won't sit well on that)!3)  start at the bottom and work your way up. (start at your calves. we will do feet and hands later). think of each area of your body as a section (calves, thighs, stomach, bumm, etc). each section gets 2 pumps. @sttropeztan express mousse is tinted so you can see where it goes but don't worry about applying too much product or going over an area twice. it doesn't matter as your skin can only absorb so much product and the @sttropeztan mitt works wonders for a smooth application. just don't miss any spots (like i said it's ok to go over an area a few times, it will dry evenly). 4) for hands, elbows, knees and feet, you don't need to add any product to the mitt, just use the excess to go over these areas (they are already moisturized from the prep and maintain lotion in step 2). you want to have your hands in a claw position so you don't get lines on your knuckles.5) take a makeup remover towelette and wipe off your nails, cuticles, palms, and bottoms of your feet.6) take the excess on the mitt and use it up towards your hairline. 7) if you don't have anyone to do your back use the @sttropeztan purity face mist to get that one spot we cannot reach ourselves. 8) leave it on for 1-3 hours and rinse (I admit, I sleep in it and shower in the am)! when i want to be extra dark, i add another layer the next night!9) use the prep to maintain instead of any other lotions and don't use any oil on your body as it will break down your tan.10) enjoy ur tan you beautiful goddess",

chrishanxoxo,"I am super excited to share this new brand that I discovered last spring @thesigntribe â¤ï¸ Itâ€™s been a gamechanger for my at-home manicure routine ever since!!! ğŸ’¯The Remove & Chill Nail Polish Remover Cream is the most gentle nail polish remover that I have ever tried. Itâ€™s the first cream remover with no acetone or harsh chemicals. The cream moisturizes both the hand skin and nails during the removing process. Most importantly, itâ€™s odorless - it leaves a pleasant scent on the nails. Dab the cream onto the nails. Let the cream sit for a few minutes. Wipe off with the Reusable Nail Polish Remover Pads. Each pad can be used for up to 25 times! No more waste! Yes, zero waste! I can even remove my makeup with these pads. ğŸ›Shop your The SIGN Tribe nail polish remover products at @ultabeauty, your nails will thank you later. ",#TheSIGNTribe

Although we are big believers that God is the best of planners and he will bless us when he knows itâ€™s best for us, we have started to do research on our specific fertility issue.I knew I needed to understand my body better and start tracking everything.

gabriellecaunesil,"Celebrating my body today, I have been upset at it lately, upset it didnâ€™t let me have a baby with the love of my life, upset for all the pain I go through every day, upset for not letting me living a life pain free. I felt resentful to it, angry. I always took my body as a machine that should work, listen to me, I pushed it over the limits, I didnâ€™t listened to its tiredness, I didnâ€™t listen to the pain. My body is a little broken, a little sick, itâ€™s not the perfect one, it doesnâ€™t work as I wish it would, but itâ€™s mine. I have to love it, I have to take care of it, I have to celebrate itâ€™s strength, itâ€™s weakness as I would for my soul. So today I am celebrating this imperfect body that is mine, at the end itâ€™s a fucking warrior, fighting everyday so I can feel better. When itâ€™s not about illness, itâ€™s about weight, shapes, we tend to hate on our bodies so easily instead of cherishing it. I donâ€™t want to take it for granted anymore. Have a nice day everyone, letâ€™s love ourselves a bit more.",

gabriellecaunesil,"One year ago @lasemaineparis was born. The biggest joy we had, us a group of women who decided to turn their lives up side down to follow their dreams. A group of women who dared to dream, dared to take their life into hands to build what they always wanted to, LSP a project by women for women. It all started in my living room, creating mood boards, building our first business plan, we were speaking English, French, Italian, Spanish every day. On the 18 this dream became reality, Lsp was out. The beginning of a journey we then shared with you, and what a year ! After, 6 drop, one worldwide pandeÌmie, 420 lives ","#lspathome we are here celebrating the most challenging of our lives, and also the most satisfying. We had many fears, we had to overcome many difficulties but we worked harder, we created new categories 100% sustainable, thanks to you we supported health workers during covid, we launched our forest Kenya. But this anniversary isnâ€™t about us, itâ€™s about you, thanks to all the amazing women who decided to trust us, drop after drop, who joined our crazy lives, shared with us some memories, took part in building a community we are so proud of. So yes, 2020 wasnâ€™t the easiest year of our lives, and we would probably have been better without it, but trough all the challenges you teached us something we always believed in, WE  ARE  STRONGER  TOGETHER ! To celebrate it with you and thank you we decided exceptionally to create a code: LSPBDAY20 and offer 20% off on all our pieces for the whole week!With love,lSP team #lasemainegirls #lasemaineparis"

gabriellecaunesil,"Endo life. Thinking of all women, men who struggles with fertility, thinking of the ones who decided not to have kids and are constantly judged, pressured. Itâ€™s been over year since I am receiving message asking me when I will get pregnant, what I am waiting for. EVERY SINGLE DAY. I cannot gain weight, I cannot be bloated, I cannot make a step without having this question coming over and over again. You remember my post in April ? I gain weight and the numbers of message concerning a potential pregnancy were so intense I had to explain myself publicly, I was not pregnant, I gained weight. While I was receiving this tsunami of pregnancy questions I was struggling privately with fertility. Today I am asking for these questions to stop, not only for me, but for all of us.  For the ones who donâ€™t want children and are pressured every day, the ones who didnâ€™t make up theirs minds yet, the ones that like me would love to but are struggling.  These messages even genuine can hurt. Itâ€™s painful. I also want to thank everyone who sent me messages today, I am reading them with tears in my eyes, I feel extremely vulnerable speaking out loud of something so close to my intimacy, something so painful. The more I am reading your messages, the more I am convinced of the need and urge to speak louder. I also want to thank the ones that are sharing with me messages hope, I am not a mother yet, but I am a auntie, a friend, a wife, an entrepreneur, a superwoman, and I wonâ€™t let my struggles define me. Neither will you. Stronger together â¤ï¸",
gabriellecaunesil,1 or 2 ? ğŸ–¤ @lasemaineparis,
gabriellecaunesil,"You ğŸ–¤ grateful to have my husband @riccardopozzoli by my side. A man that since I have been diagnosed keep getting informed online about endometriosis, keeps trying to calm my symptoms in all the way possible, grateful to have someone that I can let go with. A man that yesterday told me, after I was speaking about how infertility affect my feelings about my own femininity and sensuality, replied that I am the most gorgeous sexiest women alive, and he is more proud than ever to be next to me. Someone that hold my hand when I need it, that shares the pain and the weight of things, that take it out of my chest as much as he can. That spends times calling and writing to doctors for me, when I donâ€™t feel like I have the strength to do so. Someone that gets it, that wants to learn more, and that support me but mostly us, women. We need more of this, we need our brothers, uncles, friends to speak about our matters and to join us to have equal treatment. Equal treatment at work, in life and also in health. Feminism is a necessity; not an option.",
gabriellecaunesil,"Femininity, fertility... itâ€™s such a latent thing, we grew and live playing with baby toys, playing at being a mum when we are just 4. Infertility and femininity, how do you define that ? Somehow it makes you feel less of woman, because you are not able to nurture Life. Without even speaking about the social pressure right after getting married â€œ when is the baby for?â€ â€œStill not pregnant ?â€. Also how we treat women who decide not to become mothers because they donâ€™t want to, they way they are treated as if something was wrong with them. My struggles with fertility, my endo belly, my deception growing, the pain each month that comes with period, the shame, because yes even tho you try hard you feel ashamed. Ashamed because no one speak about this, you have to carry within yourself your pain, the stigma of the society and this terrible, deep silence. Speaking about this publicly, itâ€™s challenging. Thatâ€™s exactly because I hesitated and somehow felt ashamed, that I decided to speak even louder, because no one should be ashamed of this. Women should know about their uterus, information should be shared about what is touching our intimacy, we need to have this discussion openly so our intimate health matters becomes a priority, for the research, for the diagnostic, the cures. I am 30, when I think that I will have an ovary taken off soon, it gives me nausea, imagine... if we were telling to men we will be cutting off their balls ? We would have a cure already ! So letâ€™s speak louder ! Letâ€™s liberate the information, letâ€™s free the speech, and blow away the stigmas. I will continue to speak up, I will take it in even if itâ€™s hurting but I will never let this define me. To all the women that are going trough this, you are fucking warrior, you have all my respect and admiration, you are not alone. Stronger together. Bonne nuit.",

iconaccidental,My favorite place to shoot is on the street. ,"# ad The streets of NYC inspire me to express all the different feelings and moods I have on any given day. What I feel is like a muse that helps me decide what I want to wear and how I want to style it. Most of you know how much I love a good coat and hereâ€™s a new one for my collection. The color goes with lots of clothes I already have, especially all the earthy tones I collected last year. Itâ€™s reversible and versatile (just like me). I can wear it with a skirt, a dress or jeans and everything I decide goes with them. Since my mantra these days is comfort Iâ€™ve added a pair of cozy boots to keep me grounded and and feet on the street.  So today my streetstyle look has a soft touch, neutral colors, a skirt, some cashmere and my new @Ugg coat and boots.  I feel powerful yet mellow at the very same time.  Check out my Stories to see how I styled my coat and boots when other muses came my way.  #FEELUGG"
iconaccidental,"Dreams deferred.Many of you wrote about realizing a dream in the last post, but there were some whoâ€™s dream has to be put on hold. This is for you.I received this lovely bag as a gift from Dior in celebration of itâ€™s exclusive launch in the Dior boutique on the RueÂ Saint-HonorÃ© and thus the bagâ€™s name, â€œDior St HonorÃ©â€. The minute I heard the name and opened the bag, a memory of my very first trip to Paris returned. The visit was a long time dream deferred, yet I was only able to be there for 48 hours and had to regretfully decline invitations I had waited years to receive. I slipped away from business for a solitary hour and took a walk on the RueÂ Saint-HonorÃ©. It was here the seduction began. Teaching  responsibilities calling me home, I returned with a bottle of perfume to turn to as a potion to contain my  disappointment at having my newfound love affair end so abruptly.Sure enough as happens with a dream we hold on to and nurture even when the time may be not be right to realize it, a year later I got to return. This time I luxuriated in the history, the heritage and the delights one finds on the RueÂ Saint-HonorÃ© and elsewhere in Paris. Now with this lovely gift, a tote big enough to contain all my Paris memories, I can fly back in my imagination whenever I wish. Have you ever had a dream deferred only later to be realized?",#DiorStHonorÃ©
iconaccidental,"Heading into a new chapter.This week weâ€™ll close on our new home.

iconaccidental,"How I will manage.Since I early voted I have a plan to manage my anxiety tomorrow and prepare for the week ahead. Iâ€™m going to see my mother through a window.Because of COVID 19, quarantines, my own illness, long waits to sign up for visits and a staff member where she lives testing positive, Iâ€™ve not been able to see my mother for a very long time. While we talk on the phone and I send her goodies like the black and white cookies I used to bring her in person, itâ€™s not the same.My visits to my mother centered and stabilized me before all this began. She knows me better than anyone else. She is fierce in her strength and despite living in a nursing home remained safe and well during the surge here where we live. Sheâ€™s lived through a great depression, a world war, womenâ€™s oppression, witch hunts in the 50â€™s, civil unrest in the 60â€™s, recessions, many losses and still she maintains her faith about things coming out well.So tomorrow Iâ€™ll be with her, even though thereâ€™s a window between us. I imagine both our white hair has gotten long and sheâ€™ll be bothered by it as she prefers hers short. Sheâ€™ll help me to know that we need to look up, to rise above the negativity, the divisiveness, to draw upon the goodness in us and that we will survive no matter what just as she has.My missing part will return. She will say something that will make me laugh. On the train home again Iâ€™ll be looking up as I will during the uncertain weeks ahead.I am so lucky to still have her.",
iconaccidental,Weekend plans...try to relax. Next week will soon be here. What are your plans?,
iconaccidental,"Sitting Tight.  Today it feels like there is nothing more for me to do except sit tight. Iâ€™ve taken all the actions that are in my control and that I can. Like voting, wearing a mask and getting a flu shot.Sit tight means, â€œto sit patiently and not take any future action.â€ I feel like Iâ€™m sitting tight in every aspect of my life right now. Sit tight until the election. Sit tight until we see how the pandemic plays out this fall and winter. Sit tight until house closing day. Sit tight and donâ€™t make changes to my retirement fund. Sit tight and no travel just yet. Sit tight before starting any new projects until I move. And the list goes on.Iâ€™m not one to be sitting quietly for any length of time. I flee from a lack of stimulation like itâ€™s a tornado that will swallow me whole. I sense this sitting still and letting my body catch up with my very restless mind will bring more balance into my life and thatâ€™s a good thing.So if I have to sit tight I might as well sit pretty and do it in nature while I can.How are you handling â€œsitting tightâ€ and â€œsitting prettyâ€? ",#oldasfuk #beingolderisthrilling #transition
iconaccidental,"Grey gloomy days require a pop of color...and a kiss While usually optimistic there are some days all of whatâ€™s happening right now just gets me down. I find that what lifts me up is to keep working on my work, this public work and the work I do privately. I like this photo because it looks like someone ready to work and confident about what they do.Creating content, working with brands and writing are what I choose to do here in the space that manifests my public life. This is where I can express a different aspect of myself, a creative part. Itâ€™s why I started this in the first place. Here I can both aspire and inspire. Nonetheless it is work and requires thought, time and attention.My activism, consulting, mentoring and justice work are what I do in my private life. After briefly trying my hand at it here, Iâ€™d rather do this work collaboratively with others, in the real, not virtual world where I can actually see and feel the impact of the work we do. An Instagram story slips away in 24 hours, the relationships I continue to build in my private work last for years and are making  tangible, measurable change.Having two very different and seemingly oppositional jobs is not unusual for someone like me, itâ€™s always been my nature.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m using La Prairieâ€™s Skin Caviar Liquid Lift. Raised in alpine spring water habitats, the best quality sturgeon provide the highest quality caviar. La Prairie scientists have entered into a collaboration with a Swiss artisanal cultivator to produce a serum that gives new life and energy back to the skin.  When I use it my skin feels lifted and so is my spirit. Nature and science working hand in hand. @LAPRAIRIE #skincaviar"

iconaccidental,"Those who know me know that I love a good coat. As I prepare to move Iâ€™m going through my endless racks of clothes trying to cull down to the essentials and those pieces with the most vibrant memories attached.In the process I find my greatest attachments are to my coats and I must admit my bags. Everything else seems much easier to recycle, donate or sell.My coats comfort and warm me like a much needed hug. They are my signature when fashion week comes in February. My bags seem to contain all my little fantasies, notebooks, pens and other objects that give hints of my current pursuits. As I go through them I find business cards from events, paper clips, old lipsticks, slips of paper I sampled perfume with and half of a lost earring pair.So here I am in the midst of my last days in the city. The coat I wear is a country coat. Plaid with a fringe like the car blankets my mother threw in the station wagon for a long trip. This coat is my escort from here to there and will gather new memories as it does. The perfect companion for a new journey.Where do your clothes take you?",#transitions #coats #bags #recycle
twinkleintrendz,"Never shy away from dictating your standard. Be a part of a surrounding that truly understands you. Not everyone in this world will get you, so donâ€™t be afraid. Being with a limited number of people and getting positive energy from them is way better than being with thousands of people and still feel alone.",

alicebasso,"Come ci truccavamo una volta? Intanto la musica di sottofondo come primo step: Aqua, Britney, Blink... Che poi a 15 anni, quando ti truccavi ti veniva quellâ€™adrenalina che bo, manco stessi facendo un corso di makeup professionale con Michele Magnani. Ti tremavano sempre le mani, vuoi per lâ€™impegno che ci mettevi, per lâ€™ansia di uscire, di limonare con il fidanzatino.. Puntualmente sbagliavi tonalitÃ  di qualsiasi trucco, perchÃ© quelli mica erano tuoi, ma di tua madre, di tua sorella, di tua cugina.. tu ti dovevi truccare con gli scarti perchÃ© eri ancora troppo piccola per avere i tuoi trucchi, MA NON PER TRUCCARTIğŸ˜‚ E quindi via, kg di fondotinta, che non lo toglievi piÃ¹ fino alla maturitÃ . Matita nera, che stranamente aveva sempre la punta da fare ma avevi solo il temperino di scuola. E quindi via di strisciate nere sopra sotto dentro destra sinistra.. E chi se ne frega se non era perfetto, tu ti stavi truccando, era quello lâ€™importante. Una strisciata di ombretto glitterato, messo lÃ¬ a caso... Le sopracciglia? Chi lâ€™ha mai saputo che avremmo potuto valorizzarle.. anzi, diventavano inesistenti con i kg di fondotinta sopra.. ma tu che ne sapevi che facevi cagare cosÃ¬?! Tanto eri truccata, lâ€™importante era solo quello. Lucida labbra profumato, che poi i baci (casomai fosse successo) sarebbero stati piÃ¹ gustosi..solo che le labbra avevano resti di fondotinta, quindi a tratti pareva che le labbra non esistessero nemmeno (poveri fidanzatiniğŸ˜‚). Terra? Blush? Non pervenuti. Ma passiamo ai capelli.. Riga a zig-zag, che ci veniva sempre bene e quindi wow come sono brava ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ğŸ˜‚ Siii come nooo. Quintalate di gel, che non sia mai che mentre ti stavi baciando, ti si incastravano i capelli sullâ€™apparecchio. Forcine colorate e chi piÃ¹ ne ha piÃ¹ ne metta.. Treccine elastici colorati che quando li toglievi ti strappavi  metÃ  chioma, ma dovevi recuperare quegli elastici perchÃ© mamma non te ne avrebbe preso un altro pacchetto prima di un mese.

Logran su propÃ³sito pero necesitan un sello protector para optimizar resultados. Digamos (por ej) que tu serÃºm tiene entre sus componentes Ã¡cido hialurico el cual ayuda a preservar el agua en la piel (este Ã¡cido en su versiÃ³n sintÃ©tica es capaz de soportar hasta 1000 veces su peso en agua) pues bien, para lograr que Ã©ste y todos los otros ingredientes se queden efectivamente en tu piel y cumplan su propÃ³sito necesitamos un sello protector (que prevenga la pÃ©rdida de agua) y es ahÃ­ cuando cuando entra el rol Estrella de tu crema humectante, ya que ademÃ¡s de cÃ³mo su nombre indica humectar tu piel, evita la pÃ©rdida de agua y consigue brindarnos un aspecto hidratado y de piel plump.Que dicen?

brookecarriehil,"If we have another shut down in NYC, what are your plans (if any?) with respect to work/living arrangements/maintaining some measure of sanity? Iâ€™ve been putting the thought of this possibility off for so long now that I donâ€™t know where to begin.",

brookecarriehil,"When I was twenty five years old, I cancelled what otherwise wouldâ€™ve been my first wedding here at the Plaza. With everything I owned stuffed into large white Hefty bags, I checked into a hotel room without money, a plan or a job. I was terrified. At 5â€™8, I dropped to 107 pounds, lost a lot of friends and started a new life within the course of a day. It was the best decision of my life. Now, in my early thirties, I have so.many.girlfriends who are concerned that they wonâ€™t meet someone â€” that their time clock is ticking too quickly. If I didnâ€™t go through that experience, though, I never would have invested in myself in the way that I ultimately did. Throughout my first several years in NYC, I enjoyed many of the best experiences of my life â€” lived alone, landed a number of once in a lifetime professional opportunities, cultivated great friendships with forever friends, and then found a healthy, unexpected love with the person who I was meant to be with. If something feels even a tiny bit off to you, regardless of how good it might look on paper and/or how scared you are to acknowledge it, I encourage you to listen to your innermost voice. The only major regret I have in my life is wasting time. In being single, especially as a woman, you have a unique opportunity to invest in yourself â€” personally, professsionally, physically and spiritually â€” and so, by default, you elevate to a higher frequency and attract whatâ€™s really meant for you. Time is an illusion. Energy is real (itâ€™s scientifically proven). Go with your gut. When youâ€™re living in your truth, everything else will work itself out. I know this for sure. ğŸ’›",
brookecarriehil,"Grey skies again. ğŸ¥´ In other news, Iâ€™ve mentioned this a couple of times on stories already, but Iâ€™m putting together a master of list of fitness related questions to have answered by the experts today. If thereâ€™s anything else youâ€™d like to know about weight loss, training, getting your dream body (!!) in a healthy way, etc., leave a question in the box on my story or in the comment section below. Iâ€™ve always received a lot of inquiries about this subject, and Iâ€™ve worked out twice in my life, so I want to be able to provide you with as much  information as possible. Itâ€™s long overdue â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",
brookecarriehil,"Itâ€™s gloomy in NYC but Iâ€™m very grateful to have a professional organizer at my apartment today. Iâ€™ve moved sixteen or seventeen times within the past ten years â€” including to three different hotel rooms â€” (schools, breakups, cities), so it feels like Iâ€™m finally, finally laying a foundation in one cogent space which helps to provide order and stability. If you want pro tips regarding consolidation, folding, packing, coordinating, etc. @leahmariorganization will be at the apartment for the rest of the day, so leave any questions in the box on my most recent story and weâ€™ll answer everything this afternoon. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",
brookecarriehil,"People have told me that I often smooth my skin too much in photos, so I figured Iâ€™d post a round of completely unretouched/unedited pics that we captured this morning at sunrise. For the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been spending most of my time working on initiatives for Areppas and nurturing my new platforms, so I havenâ€™t been able to capture much street style lately â€” that said, in between downpours, Iâ€™m putting on  different looks and making the most of the day. How are you? What are you up to? PS â€” Iâ€™m not just asking! I genuinely love to hear from you and to know whatâ€™s going on. ğŸ’›ğŸ˜˜",
brookecarriehil,"There are plenty of negative things that can be said about me, and some of them are true, but one thing is indisputable: I'm deeply passionate about wanting to help women feel look and feel like the best versions of themselves. In my life, it was extremely difficult for me to cultivate self-confidence, so if liking the way you look serves as a helpful crutch, I don't believe thereâ€™s any harm in understanding the specific tips and tricks that are effective in enabling you to be happy with your physical appearance. As you know, I'm very open about showing the good, the bad and the ugly, and the before here is...well, itâ€™s aggressive, but by having the right hair and makeup techniques, as well as other tools that I'll delve into further on a very â€˜micro levelâ€™, I guarantee that you can be confident in the way that you carry yourself every single day. I'm not suggesting that you have to have a full glam team to look like your best â€” this reel is just a fun way to show you the dramatic effects of some particularly helpful tactics â€” but at this point, Iâ€™ve gotten my â€˜maintenanceâ€™ down to a science, and I promise that itâ€™s easy enough for everyone to implement and learn. I have a lot more to come on this subject, but in the meantime, thank you to @glossipgirl and @avi_pinhasov for being two of the best in your respective fields.

Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming election, Iâ€™m admittedly concerned about what might take place. I understand that tensions are at all an time high right now, so Iâ€™m praying that that we work together to stay safe as a people and to commit to healing the very major issues that continue to plague our nation. Despite your political affiliation, Iâ€™m sending you strength, love and peace of mind as we navigate these difficult times. â¤ï¸",

sophiachang,"Master bathroom reveal ~ swipe to check out the before. also, shoutout to the best dad in the world ğŸ¤We made some small cosmetic changes to the master bath to make the space feel more elevated. This bathroom always felt a little sterile with the blue toned vanity, mirror, and tiles. To add some warmth we simply switched out all hardware to aged brass and that immediately balanced the tones making it feel more welcoming. I went with two separate mirrors instead of one long piece this time and I think it added so much character! It really goes to show that a few minor cosmetic changes can make the biggest difference in your home. Oh, and a fresh lick of paint of course.",

sophiachang,"ğŸ’­ Itâ€™s been a couple of weeks since I last posted. Often times I find myself overwhelmed with the idea that I have to document every part of my life. If Iâ€™m not vlogging Iâ€™m either shooting stills or stories. If Iâ€™m not doing either of those things you can most likely find me glued to my computer screen for 12 hours at a time editing. This isnâ€™t me complaining, but more so realizing the constant pressure I put on myself to always feel like I need to be on. It feels impossible to manage all these different platforms and constantly push out content. Well actually, itâ€™s not impossible but I do find that my happiness is compromised. Iâ€™ve realized that there will be seasons where Iâ€™m more active on my channel and maybe less active on ig (or vice versa) and thatâ€™s totally ok. I would much rather focus my energy on one thing and feel more connected with the content Iâ€™m creating rather than doing it just to fill in the blank spaces. I usually donâ€™t write long captions or even begin to open up on this platform, but Iâ€™m hoping to speak more freely about whatever is on my mind. Since weâ€™re on the topic of that- the anticipation of this election is killing me. Patiently waiting on the results from the outstanding states. I know everyoneâ€™s feeling anxious so remember to check in with yourself, nurture your body, and take a break when needed. ğŸ’­ sidenote- Leo seems more exhausted from the news than me.",

iamcattsadler,"After delivering new episodes every week for more than a year and growing a most sensational and dedicated podcast community, I pressed pause on @nakedpod a few months back. So much had happened in 2020 that I wanted to reflect and dream and consider a new way. I have changed immensely this year and through my own growth I have ultimately decided to officially retire NAKED. After much soul searching, and truthfully a few business snafus, I decided to honor myself and my new vision in the podcast space. There are a gazillion podcasts, but I have always prided myself on the uniqueness my guests and I bring to the table. Authenticity, soul, an ability to connect in a meaningful way. Iâ€™ll be damned - this pandemic has grabbed ahold of us. All of us. Life just isnâ€™t the same. So why do the same?Â Â I feel pulled to put out something new and different. To birth something else. Something even better! And so thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve done. While I canâ€™t announce yet what that is, I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, your patience, your devotion. I hope I can count on all of you to join me on this new journey soon. And in this moment I feel compelled to quote @glennondoyle: â€œDestructionÂ is essential toÂ construction.

When one of my friends and favorite designers @zoechiccojewelry selected me to take part in her 20x20 initiative and design a piece for charity, the vision was instinctual and instant! Some of you know Iâ€™ve been slowly removing a few tattoos and so while Iâ€™m erasing the symbol on my arm, I now have this gorgeous and meaningful ring instead - and you can, too!

vanillagirl_86,"â€œCiao sono Paper,arrivo da un canile della Sicilia, da Campobello di Licata. Nel 2017 grazie al mio nuovo padrone,Marco,sono arrivata a Torino e ho trovato tanto amore. Certo ho dovuto un poâ€™ adattarmi ad una cittaÌ€ cosiâ€™ sabauda,ma me ne sono innamorata subito e tutto quello che mi stava capitando sapeva di bello.Non esiste confine per ricevere amore. Sono fortunata oggi e posso testimoniare che cioâ€™ che sono, deriva solo da un sentimento puro e incondizionato e tutto questo non ha prezzo. Ho incontrato in questi primi anni della mia nuova vita tante persone per strada, quando ancora si poteva, e devo dirvi che piacere ed essere accolta con una carezza dal cuore mi ha resa piuÌ€consapevole. Consapevole che esistono persone belle ma che a volte ci vuole solo il momento giusto per incontrarle e per viverle. Tutti mi chiedono di che razza sono per conoscermi meglio, ma in realtaâ€™ solo in un secondo momento ho scoperto di essere uno spino degli Iblei, un antico cane da pastore da guardiania siciliano, tipico dell'area pedemontana dei monti Iblei.  Chi lâ€™avrebbe mai detto... la vita eâ€™ davvero incredibile, mi piacerebbe potervi raccontare il primo pezzo della mia vita,cosa eâ€™ stato, ma quello che conta eâ€™ il presente,il passato mi ha resa forte e mi ha permesso di apprezzare la dolcezza umana. In un periodo come questo soÌ€ quanto bene posso donare e quanto câ€™eÌ€ bisogno di dimostrarlo,soÌ€ che cosa significa sentirsi soli,quindi il mio legame con chi amo eÌ€ ancora piuâ€™ forte. Non eâ€™ solo tenersi compagnia ma eâ€™ molto di piuâ€™, ve lo posso assicurare. Tutto questo per dirvi che lâ€™amore universale per un animale eâ€™ tutto quello che non si puoâ€™ immaginare,chi conosce saÌ€ di cosa sto parlando. Insieme a me nella vita di Marco,eâ€™ arrivata Cristina...â€Ehi ehi qui tocca a me Paper, grazieğŸ¤£Si sono arrivata nella vita di Marco con te ed eâ€™ stato bellissimo. Devo dirti che sei stata una sorpresa della vita. Sei dolce e i tuoi occhi sono umani. Testona ma bella bella, una nuvola bianca di zucchero filato in mezzo ai colori del mondo...

La tua storia eâ€™ un inno ad ogni rinascita, eâ€™ un inno alla vita. Grazie per aver condiviso una parte di te di cui il mondo ha bisogno, la tua parte piuâ€™ coraggiosa e piuâ€™ profonda. â€œ Se non ami te stesso e quella parte di te non puoi proiettare felicitaâ€™.La veritaÌ€â€™ mi ha reso liberoâ€ Da una panchina diversa ma pur sempre di provincia..GRAZIE TIZIANO!!!Per chi non sapesse, le nostre vie si sono incrociate cosiâ€™:tua fan nel pubblico di un tuo concerto al Parco Chico Mendez di Borgaro Torinese ad ascoltare il tuo XDONO, a colonna sonora nel 2004 di uno dei momenti piuÌ€â€™ forti della mia famiglia, per poi incontrarti nello stesso anno durante la mia favola di Miss Italia dove eri ospite dâ€™onore e da liÌ€ mille incontri dettati da una vita fortunata.

christie_ferrari,Oliverâ€™s feeling better & excited for his first Christmas! Sharing what Santaâ€™s bringing him and gift ideas for a baby under 1 over on the blog (link in bio & on stories) from @buybuybaby  AD,
christie_ferrari,"Poor Oliver spent the night in the ER. He spiked a high fever last night and our on call dr told us to take him in. It thankfully broke with medicine. He still had to get some work up done (which he hated - poor little man) because the fever came back - but thankfully everything came back normal. We just got home - He has had a rough 12 hours, to say the least â¤ï¸.",
christie_ferrari,"Todayâ€™s look for Oliverâ€™s 2 month Drs Apt! He is now weighing 8 lbs and 12 Oz. For those that donâ€™t know Oliver was born 3 weeks early and was IUGR (he had stopped growing in utero) so to say we have gotten this far is pretty exciting!! We also had our vaccines today - he did cry but was a trooper. For that reason, we are going to enjoy some extra cuddles today!",

Oliverâ€™s favorite things are bath time (he finds them so relaxing), he loves to kick his legs - in the bath and in his play gym. Will he be the next Messi? âš½ï¸ (Dad is Argentinian like Messi). Music wise he loves Mozart, Olafur Arnalds, and Nils Frahm. He no longer likes to sleep all day and mornings have become his play time! And we no longer roll on our side when we are put on our back.

christie_ferrari,Mamaâ€™s night out and dressing up felt soooo good! Continue for a ,"#DrCsDressForTheMoodYouWant post. Iâ€™m a big proponent that dressing up can impact oneâ€™s mood - research has been done on this that supports it too! After a chaotic 9 months, dressing up and going out for the first time actually provided a bit of escapism for me. On one hand, Iâ€™m a new mom and havenâ€™t dressed up like this for quite some time but also on the other hand, during uncertain times like these, it provided a sense of normalcy even if just for a short moment (ps - donâ€™t worry! I also wore a mask, but took it off for the picture). For this outing, I opted for a classic button down dress in navy - a reliable option that could provide comfort because a button down will always look good (dependable) and blue has been shown to be a calming color. I suppose blue was also a good choice because I was away from my boys for the first time too! Wore this look to celebrate the opening of @renecaovilla Bal Harbour store"
christie_ferrari,"Real Talk post! Not going to lie, I used to think Iâ€™d be able to have a clean house, dress up, look put together, and get my work down, while still paying attention to the baby, Alex and our pup postpartum (without help)! Boy was I wrong. Todayâ€™s ","#DrsCsTips is on getting used to my new normal postpartum.First of all, I think I had forgotten that sleep, or lack there of would totally interfere with my productivity level. While Iâ€™ve definitely adjusted to the lack of sleep Iâ€™ve had to make some adjustments ğŸ’­ So this #DrCspost is for the mamas, though these 3 tips can apply to anyone! Tip 1. Adjust my expectations.I had to redefine what was a successful day.  What I once used to achieve before is no longer, and especially with a newborn! Personally, I now only take on one big task a day (one job a day, an outing, focus on pictures, etc) and I call that a win! Tip 2. Ask for help. I used to want to do it all. I slowly shifted away from this and started asking the hubs and my mom to help with responsibilities so I could get things done. Tip 3.Do at least one thing for myself each day. Whether itâ€™s a shower, put on make up, or a 10-minute alone me-time break I do at least one thing a day for my self-care. Xo,Dr. C"

alyshanett,Creativity has been sparse this year. Grateful to @arturoshoots for inspiring me with his FaceTime sessions. Happy I could be apart of it back in May. ğŸ“²ğŸ’»ğŸ“¸,
alyshanett,"Hey everyone, how are you? Thank you to those that checked in with me over the summer. I appreciate all of your warm thoughts and vibes. I want you to know Iâ€™m doing okay. Better, for sure. But because Iâ€™m feeling better Iâ€™m still apprehensive about returning full time to social media. Iâ€™m in between therapists right now and feel like i should continue to maintain a healthy distance from the internet for the time being. Mentally Iâ€™m feeling better but Iâ€™d be lying if I said it isnâ€™t hard. I have a tough time with the idea of being on here pretending that things are A-ok when quite frankly theyâ€™re not. Social media is a powerful tool and Iâ€™ve felt itâ€™s effects literally change my brain and how it functions. I tried to fight it, to stay aware of the change so I could act against it, but after a certain point I just gave in. I donâ€™t want to do that anymore. I want my life to be my own. Yesterday was my birthday and Iâ€™m so grateful to still be here on this fucked up earth celebrating life. As grim as it may seem to be right now, hold on to hope that things can change. You have the power to step away from people & things that are no longer serving you. Protect your energy. My birthday wish this year is to see my peers register to vote and make their voices heard! Letâ€™s work together to be the change we need. ğŸ’•ğŸ’• PS- If you want to support me and view the exclusive content Iâ€™ve been creating while away, i now have an OF account for content deemed â€œtoo spicyâ€ for social media platforms. Itâ€™s fun over there. ğŸ€ğŸ€ Love you all, stay strong.",
alyshanett,"Hey everyone. Full transparency- since the beginning of the pandemic Iâ€™ve felt myself slip. In fact I guess I can honestly say Iâ€™ve been slipping for years but the isolation paired with the feelings of helplessness caused my depression to slip further than ever before. I have been struggling with severe PTSD & depression for several years (likely undiagnosed for most of my life) and my addiction to social media increases my symptoms. About a month ago i was able to start receiving treatment for the first time in my life. After talking things over with my therapist, Iâ€™ve decided to take the summer off from social media. After 12 years online, itâ€™s time for a break. My brain is sick and i need to help myself so i can help others and use this platform to itâ€™s full capacity. The only platform i will continue updating is my P@tre0n for any creative works Iâ€™m able to make during this time. (If you are a member i highly recommend downloading the app for updates.) Itâ€™s not my intention to take away any focus from the Black & Brown lives that need our love & support now more than ever. I will continue to be an ally, donating my time & resources to the BLM movement and I hope all of you continue to advocate for justice and human rights in your daily lives. I love you all, thank you for your continued support over the years. I hope to see you again in a few months when my brain is healthy again. â¤ï¸ Stay strong!",
alyshanett,"Itâ€™s not enough to be outraged. What are you doing with that anger? White people Iâ€™m talking to you! Youâ€™re upset about rioting and looting? Why?

THEY DO! â€œUnited we stand, divided we fall.â€ Listen. Learn. Educate YOURSELF and then take those hard conversations to the dinner table. Call your dad out for being a racist jerk.

It means take away some of the responsibilities they have at this current moment and give those responsibilities to properly trained departments, moving the amount of money spent on police force elsewhere, i.e. defund. The cops (at least the way theyâ€™ve been trained to this point, which btw only requires 8 hours of conflict management annually, and many states donâ€™t require any de-escalation training) do not need to be the first responders to many of these situations.

Found this quote by George Barnard Shaw in my little welcome book from @civanaresort that I visited in ","#arizona last week. Such a powerful quote especially now.The resort is a wellness paradise perfect for unplugging and reconnecting with yourself and nourishing your mind and soul in a serene and healthy (and of course socially distant!) environment. #CIVANA is actually the top 10 #wellness resort and their spa is #3 in the US by some rankings (their Aqua vitality circuit is definitely a life-changer). Nested in the Sonoran Desert just outside Scottsdale, this place makes a perfect vitality getaway. With 10 000 sq ft of fitness and yoga centers, 70+ classes per week, 2 daily hikes and meditation opportunities, 2 heated salt-water pools, and 2 restaurants with healthy dining options youâ€™ll definitely leave the place healthier and happier #dianashotels"
dianamarksofficial,My vehicle during Arizona travels was the 2020 ,"#LexusUX hybrid in the beautiful nori green color. The beauty of hybrids is of course their fuel-efficiency. I still canâ€™t get over the fact that a full tank of gas was roughly $15 ğŸ˜The car is compact yet spacious, it runs smoothly over rough roads. The seats are comfortable, the interior looks great, and lots of helpful features come standard. The only downsideÂ I encountered was the frustrating touchpad infotainment controls. I guess if I spent more days with the car it wouldnâ€™t be a problem eventually, but for a person switching vehicles as frequently as I do, it was a bit of a challenge getting used to it. Also, opening a gas tank took me good 5-7 minutes until I figured that tapping it a hundred times wonâ€™t work, googled and found out there is a button to open it inside the vehicle #blondeÂ Overall, this is a perfect fuel-efficient luxury entry-level SUV with modern and stylish design and good maneuverability. At $34,500 MSRP this is definitely a great value car as well #lexuspartner #ad @lexususa #girlslovecoolcars Top via @forbloggersonly"
dianamarksofficial,My favorite part about Arizona are those epic sunsets. I feel lucky being able to witness it at @sanctuaryaz_ . The whole property provides panoramic views and a feeling no other ,"#Scottsdale luxury hotel can provide. The pool, for example, overlooks the Camelback mountain which will hide the sun behind creating breathtaking light and glow. In addition to this, the resort offers a world-class sanctuary spa, great food with innovative dining from their celebrity chef Beau MacMillian and amazingly spacious rooms and villas, no wonder the hotel was ranked top 2015 resort in #Arizona .

dianamarksofficial,Something attracts me to a ,"#desert in my latest travels ğŸŒµ I remember reading about it so vividly and poetically described in the Alchemist. It was so exotic for me given that I was born and raised in Belarus and the climate is nothing like it. I honestly donâ€™t remember the first time I experienced the desert, but lately itâ€™s been my go-to place. Of course I am still a spoilt millennial so I definitely need my car with AC, enough water and plenty of breaks in the car to catch some cold air and relax before being in the sun again. And out of all car brand I cannot imagine a better fit for exploring the desert (in my case it was #JoshuaTree) and fully soaking it in.  You can do cool things like off-roading without a single fear of being stuck while staying comfortable and super safe ğŸ˜ #girlslovecoolcars Iâ€™ll leave you with one of my favorite thought provoking quotes ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ â€œWhat makes a desert beautiful,â€ said the little prince, â€œis that somewhere it hides a wellâ€.~ The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery"

They redesigned and upgraded quite a few features in their #Stelvio in 2020. Its interior features a redesigned, refined, race-inspired aesthetic that maximizes functionality without sacrificing performance. My favorites are:- 8.8-inch touch screen ğŸ˜- Wireless charging - super cool, just put the phone in the designated pocked and it will start charging automatically- Active Driver Assistance Package - gives drivers added confidence behind the wheel.

I know the rapid test is only 65% accurate- so I went ahead and got the real time PCR test as well and that too was positive. I didnâ€™t post anything for a few days because I wasnâ€™t sure if I wanted to make this public, but today- something in me said that I have to do this.

Iâ€™ve honestly got so many compliments on my skin lately!I used their Vita C eyes dark circle corrector and Glycolic Acid Brightening Serum, that both contain a very potent, highly absorbing gold stabilised form of Vitamin C. We all know how important Vitamin C is for brightening and in my case, to help reduce the acne scars. ğŸŠThe Nutrient Charged Water Gel is the perfect moisturiser for those who need the hydration but donâ€™t like a very heavy formula (works for all skin types) and great for the colder months!ğŸ’§Lastly, I use their Age Balancing Moisture Broad Spectrum. I love layering moisturisers because my skin gets so dry this time of the year, that I need all the hydration I can get. Plus, this one has SPF 30, and we all know how important sun protection is. I also use their retinol at night, so that makes SPF all the more essential.â˜€ï¸(Also I havenâ€™t left out my forehead, just removed those clips in edit in order to make the video under a minute)",#MuradxNykaa #OnlyAtNykaa #MuradSkincare

As much as I love being out in nature and the calmness of being on a horse, I also love all of the equestrian fashion.

I finally got the keys in March so I havenâ€™t actually been to see it since before that. I got @venturainteriordesign to do my apartment years ago so I always knew I would get them to do this. All of it was done over zoom with samples being sent back and forth. I love everything to do with interiors and @venturainteriordesign were so helpful, even now when I keep adding things ğŸ˜‚ They just got my vibe straight away, beachy, modern and relaxed. I really hope I can get home to see it in person soon, itâ€™s the perfect place for our family to spend lots of time. We may never move home full time but itâ€™s so important for our children to have their Irish roots and you never know a bit of an Irish accent ğŸ˜‚",

HOW TO ENTER:Click the link in my bio and please donate a minimum Â£5 or as much as you can, then comment below and you could be in with a chance of winning this YSL bag. Terms and conditions : The competition is open to everyone. The winner will be chosen at random using an app to do so. I will announce the winner on December 14th so you have your bag in time for Christmas. Itâ€™s a suggested donation so please leave what you can.

So, if youâ€™re looking for a sign to apply for that job youâ€™ve been eyeing, here it is! Alsooooooo, this is not a message to say that your imposter syndrome is the only thing standing between you and your dream job. Unfortunately, there are a lot of unconscious biases that go into hiring and something companies need to actively work on. But, Iâ€™m simply sharing that you donâ€™t have to check all of the boxes to apply for a role youâ€™re interested in. So, if you have the privilege of time to apply, give it a shot!",

You were such a beautiful, talented, supporting, important person to every single one of us that had the pleasure of meeting you. You made everyone laugh, you dressed up to have a movie night, you sang your heart out to express yourself, you loved like there was no end to love. There is so much I wish I could have said to you. So much I learned from you. The memories we have of you are my favorite. Like having a side conversation at a party or our favorite double dates or beating Drew in croquet.

Il nero ha il suo fascino, il bianco anche!Gioca con forme e colori scoprendo le emozioni che ti danno, giocandoci, imparando a valorizzare le tue caratteristiche invece che a nasconderti, perchÃ© quando ci nascondiamo (sotto gli abiti, ma non solo) spesso Ã¨ perchÃ© non stiamo poi cosÃ¬ bene con noi stessi.Ci possono essere emozioni o sentimenti che ci fanno soffrire, puÃ² essere amore, lavoro, salute, un lutto...I motivi possono essere tanti e non sono qui a dirti come affrontare le cose...ma se sono legati alla percezione del tuo corpo, alla dismorfia, allâ€™idea che solo con un corpo â€œperfettoâ€ e â€œdiverso dal tuoâ€ varrai qualcosa, sappi che puoi fare qualcosa per te stess*accrescendo la tua consapevolezza che si manifesterÃ  anche attraverso il tuo corpo, ma che non dipenderÃ  direttamente da quello!Poi personalmente sono sempre piÃ¹ convinta che quando ci mettiamo sul cammino per comprenderci, accoglierci, accertarci (in toto come individuali, non solo dal punto di vista estetico) poi possiamo fare tutto!Possiamo migliorarci come esseri umani, possiamo dare tanto agli altri, possiamo far sÃ¬ che dalle ferite entri la LUCE (frase non mia, ma che amo).Insomma Ciapin, vale la pena cercare di volersi bene e rispettarsi, anche se non capiamo ancora bene come fare, anche se ci sono delle giornate che proprio stare con noi stessi Ã¨ tremendo...VALE LA PENA â™¥ï¸Anche se quando metti un pantalone bianco ti chiamano culona (aneddoti da il mio libro â€œNoi siamo Luceâ€ - lo hai letto?)E vale la pena cercare di fare qualcosa di costruttivo per la comunitÃ  ğŸŒCiapa li e ciapa la",#LisaKott #curvynstyle

As much as I am grateful for the voice that social media gives each of us, I am equally grateful to step back and live my life in the present moment ğŸ˜Šâœ¨â£â£I sometimes find myself falling in the trap of feeling as though itâ€™s only worth taking a photo if it looks good. If I look good. If it matches my feed, or itâ€™s something you guys would be interested in. Being transparent, that is SO not how I want to live my life. ğ˜™ğ˜¦ğ˜¢ğ˜­ ğ˜­ğ˜ªğ˜§ğ˜¦ ğ˜ªğ˜´ğ˜¯â€™ğ˜µ ğ˜¤ğ˜¶ğ˜³ğ˜¢ğ˜µğ˜¦ğ˜¥. ğ˜ğ˜µâ€™ğ˜´ ğ˜¯ğ˜°ğ˜µ ğ˜±ğ˜¦ğ˜³ğ˜§ğ˜¦ğ˜¤ğ˜µ & ğ˜µğ˜©ğ˜¦ğ˜³ğ˜¦â€˜ğ˜´ ğ˜¯ğ˜° ğ˜¯ğ˜¦ğ˜¦ğ˜¥ ğ˜§ğ˜°ğ˜³ ğ˜ªğ˜µ ğ˜µğ˜° ğ˜£ğ˜¦. â£â£Itâ€™s a bit of a head game, because a huge part of working online IS trying to capture your attention with something visually appealing & I find that super overwhelming most days. â£â£I often get caught up feeling as though I canâ€™t post â€˜regular thingsâ€™ - they (truly) do not get the engagement that a curated photo would & it does play with your feelings when itâ€™s interwoven with your jobâ€™s â€˜successâ€™. No matter how strong one is mentally, humans weâ€™re not meant for this much constant feedback from such a large group. The positive OR the negative. â£â£Sometimes you just gotta step back and focus on the few voices around you that actually matter in your day to day life. Creating that space for yourself is important. âœ¨âœ¨ğŸ™ŒğŸ¼â£â£SO, I took a little break from it all. I didnâ€™t take any work photos for the entirety of the past month. I didnâ€™t take a selfie with my hair and makeup done, I didnâ€™t worry about an engaging caption and whether or not the image would preform well.

lopezjennylopez,"Say hello to the â€œNEWESTâ€ addition in my morning skincare routine @opteskin For the first couple of months of my pregnancy, I started developing hyperpigmentation on my cheeks. It has been a journey, discovering what helps to keep the spots neutralize without putting my health and skin at risk.OPTE helps camouflage discoloration and treats hyperpigmentation with niacinamide, one of the key activeingredients in OPTEâ€™s serum. Withconsistent use, niacinamide is clinically proven to help fade the appearance of hyperpigmentation over time. The most important thing for me when it comes to skin, itâ€™s that my face always looks radiant, I donâ€™t like to wear much makeup, I  always try to avoid the â€œcake face lookâ€. Even though OPTE covers my flaws, it looks very natural on my skin, and only deposits the product where is needed and  It lets my natural radiance shine.I will be sharing my before and after in my stories!

thelenparentstyle,"I am super in love with my eye mask from  @viicodebeauty (VIIcode pronounce 'vee too code'). The  @viicodebeauty O2M Oxygen Eye Mask is an 8-hour overnight treatment containing a moon shaped gel-like patch that you stick under each eye. The product itself is like a gel consistency and does not drip or run down your face. When I applied the mask to my under eye area it was an instant cooling sensation. It truly was a refreshing feeling. And oddly enough that cool sensation lasted throughout the night. With the O2M Oxygen Eye Mask I saw a visible difference just after one use. I woke up with super soft under eye skin that was visibly supple and moisturized and NOT puffy! My skin did not feel tight or constricted like usual and I was so satisfied. If you suffer from any of these problems, you might just love these eye masks! @viicodebeauty recommends using them three times per week. I like the idea of having the important skincare ingredients on my skin for 8 hours, not just a few minutes. All in all, I would highly recommend the @viicodebeauty Skin Care O2M Oxygen Eye Mask to anyone interested in showing their under eyes some TLC!

vasjmorgan,"2020 has been a challenging year for us all. We have shared so much devastation and last week, triggered by a betrayal that I didnâ€™t see coming I had a brief mental breakdown. As I sat alone on a hotel bed in what felt like the darkest time of my life I thought that someone had put a curse on me. I received 3 huge blows of bad news in one morning. The pain I felt was immeasurable. I cried alone for hours. Loneliness is a huge trigger for me and I had never felt more alone. Usually I would call my sister Bianca then work my way through my family but on this day I felt I couldnâ€™t burden them anymore. They worry so much about me and it doesnâ€™t feel fair. So I decided to call some of my best friends. I called Rita and I just cried. Immediately, without me saying a word she knew exactly what to say she spoke for a while and I just listened. She reminded me that I am not alone and that I am loved and valued. â€œYou will get through thisâ€ Then I called one of my oldest friends Victoria. Sheâ€™s a great person to call in a crisis because she donâ€™t panic or worry she just says the right things. I called my best friend Michael; He shows little to no emotion ever but heâ€™s a very practical person. Finally, I called my manager and dear friend Leisa, by this point I was less emotional; She told me that I am not cursed I am blessed and whatever has happened there will be a positive in those messages somewhere I just need to search for them.That was an important message. After those phone calls I felt so much better, so much stronger. I left the hotel and drove to my friend Rafaâ€™s house and spent a couple days with his beautiful family. They feel like my own family when Iâ€™m in LA so that was the perfect environment to heal. I booked a flight that weekend and flew home to my sister. Today, a week later. I feel great.Feelings swing in roundabouts. Up and down and thatâ€™s ok. Itâ€™s ok to feel pain and to feel sad. Do not let those feeling consume you. Remind yourself that you are loved and that you are important. I wanted to share that story with you all because the tools I used may be lifesaving. CALL SOMEONE. Do not suffer alone.

Even fewer believe enough in themselves and their gut feel to follow it through and reap the benefit.Mothers are highly intuitive. That is a fact that even doctors and scientists acknowledge. There have been enough documented cases of mothers intuitively knowing when their children are in trouble, even if far away. Many a time a mother has felt a strong urge to reach out to her child and followed the instinct to find her child in trouble. ....ğŸ“¸ @oxanaalexphotography",

brittnyward,"Hey guys! Little update on Hendrix. Hendrixâ€™s febrile seizure was not caused by any â€œbugâ€ or COVID. He has tested negative for everything. His febrile seizure was caused by the MMR vaccine. Our pediatrician pretty much confirmed that. He received the MMR vaccine 7 days before his seizure. Although seizures are more on the â€œrareâ€ side, after talking to so many parents they are much more common than we would like to think. I am not advocating to not vaccinate your child, but encouraging you to ask your doctor a million questions and ask about the possible side effects. I wish our pediatrician educated me or warned me, but the vaccine was given as casually as a diaper change. The MMR vaccine is apparently notorious for bad side effects. So do your homework and donâ€™t feel bad for advocating for your childâ€™s health! Stay safe â¤ï¸",

Instead of putting up a Christmas tree which might take up quite a bit of space, I decided to get everyone involved in a fun make-your-own Christmas Garland activity using Mimosas, Olive and Eucalyptus leaves I got from the wholesaler. We then hung up each personâ€™s garland using the @takecommandsg Decorating Clips and Mini Clear hooks (the hooks are really easy to remove and donâ€™t leave a mark) and some twine. This is a super fun and easy DIY activity for your family and friends, so get some people over during the next few weekends for a heartwarming bonding session.

carolinaogliaro,"Maybe I am naive or maybe I am too classic, but I always think that having a person leaning on you while you wrap him in your arms and this person remain there, confident and helpless, a little fragile and a little curious, is l the best feeling ever.The scent of his hair, as you read a poem to him and you can feel even if he gives you his back, his curious eyes that wander around, the hand that seeks phisical contact and the little smile that hides behind his shirt.I always think this is one of the most adorable and least considered moments of intimacy in the world... Those arms become a safe harbor of the other person and poems and books, you read them only to those who you really care about because you hope that between the lines they will be able to grasp what you cannot say in words.And if you allow someone or something to separate you, you deserve a conviction for universal crime against pure feeling.Soundtrack ~ "" Don't let me go"" by @cigsaftersex",

Layla has been loving taking photos with it as well as keeping track of how many steps she takes in a day.  As a parent there is so much to worry about with kids but this really helps me, especially when Layla heads back to school or goes to a friends house, Iâ€™m always able to track her and know that she can contact me whenever she needs. #Xplora #MyXplora #GOPLAY"

Iâ€™m not too open on insta cause itâ€™s just my business but I struggle w depression, addiction, and anxiety.

Basically what Iâ€™m trying to say is that Iâ€™ve been realizing things instead of being ashamed and embarrassed abt my rocky past. I have to fully take responsibility so I can love myself and embrace all those dark parts so they can come to light and I can move forward .... I also just wanna make my brother proud. RIP, so just basking on the negative isnâ€™t going to cut it for me.

For those of you unfamiliar with Biossance, they are a cruelty free, vegan skincare line focused on clean products that are made while also being kind to the environment. You can purchase everything I used @sephora.Step 1: Start with freshly cleansed skinStep 2: Squalane + Hyaluronic Toning MistStep 3: Squalane + Marine Algae Eye CreamStep 4: Squalane + Lactic Acid Resurfacing Night Serum-Step 5: Squalane + Omega Repair Cream Step 6: Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Oil Step 7: Squalane + Rose Vegan Lip Balm Pro Tip:  Use oil to lock in your moisture as you sleep. Instead of rubbing in the oil, dab or pat it onto the skin. This will help your pores absorb the product versus just sliding the oil around on your skinâ€™s surface.

glitterandlazers,"Ready, Set Glow! Today Iâ€™m using @tula products to get a nice glowy, radiant complexion.  I love working with Tula because they donâ€™t promote unattainable beauty standards- they show only real people, with real skin. Can I get an amen? Theyâ€™re also cruelty free and built on the benefits of probiotics and super foods.  If you want to try any of these products for yourself, use code GLITTERANDLAZERS on tula.com to save 15%. Pro Tip: Use your toner after you cleanse, but  BEFORE you mask. It calms your skin after cleansing and makes your masks so much more effective. Speaking of masks- @tulaâ€™s Detox in a jar is one of my favorites and is really good for cleaning out those poors and reducing bumps, while still leaving your skin super soft. This mask paired with the 24-7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night Cream is a gamechanger. Step One: Cleanse with Cult Classic purifying face cleanserStep Two: Get Toned pro-glycolic 10% resurfacing tonerStep 3: Detox in Jar Purifying Face Mask (2-3x per week, not everyday)Step 4: Signature Glow- Refreshing and Brightening Face Step 5: Glow Hour Brightening & Neutralizing Eye Balm Step 6: 24-7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night Cream ",#TULAPartner #EmbraceYourSkin

glitterandlazers,"I was speaking to someone yesterday about how different this year has been. Itâ€™s been a hard year for no less than 5,478 different and totally unpredictable  reasons. That said, every negative thing that has happened has in some way or other forced me to change for the better. I didnâ€™t see it at first. No, I was too bogged down in the overwhelmingness of it all. However the last feels weeks have been oddly different. Iâ€™m noticing new talents and I am seeing progress where I least expected it. I genuinely thought this would be the year to break us, but now I pretty certain it will be the year to make us.",

hadasahlove,"Being healthy and surrounded by love are two things I never take for granted. I feel so extremely thankful my mom taught me to prioritize and work on my physical health. And I want to remind you how valuable and worthy this is. Also, I believe in the importance of preventive care as it helps us live longer and healthier lives and avoid life-threatening diseases. So, I appreciate that health screenings like Pap and HPV can be available to all women. The Pap test has been leading the fight against cervical cancer for decades. And did you know that before the introduction of the screening, cervical cancer was the number 1 cancer killer of women? Now, itâ€™s number 14. But now proposed changes to the guidelines could eliminate the Pap leaving thousands of women vulnerable to incomplete testing and we canâ€™t let that happen. We need to come together as a community and have a voice in the health guidelines to protect and improve our lives. For the health of all women, the Pap and HPV tests should remain a part of our routine wellness screening. ",#ProtectThePap ğŸ’•
